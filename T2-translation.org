* PART FIVE.
** FIRST CHAPTER. Different Tools.
*** SECTION ONE. Compass, Calibers, Squares.

We gave at the beginning of our first Volume the nomenclature and the description of the proper tools to be executed on the Lathe all the parts we have spoken of in this Volume; but these tools become insufficient for the more difficult works, which we are going to

take care of, and we believe we should begin this second Volume in the same way, with a list of more sought-after tools, necessary for the execution of the pieces that we propose to teach there.

  Fig. 1, Pl. 1, shows a rod compass, suitable for cutting cardboard, copper and veneer. The handle a is a little big, and can easily be grasped with the left hand, while with the right the cutting tip b is rotated. Below the handle is a conical point, called a Mushroom, which, by its shape, has the ability to be placed in a hole, more or less large, as needed. A box, fig.2, pierced with a hole right by the rod, slides over it, and can be set to the desired spacing: it is retained in its place, using a pressure screw c, which presses against the rod, without however spoiling it, by means of a bacon interposed between them. Perpendicular to the box is a point, fig. 4, retained in its place by the stirrup, fig. 3, which embraces the box on its thickness, and fixes the point at the desired height: this point is sharpened in rhombus like a chisel; and it is at the angle opposite to its bevel that you cut copper or wood. If it is cardboard, put a point c in it, fig. 7.

  Fig. 5 is another rod compass, which is used only for dividing and drawing circles. On the rod are two movable boxes: one has a point, and can slide down the length of the rod; the other b, can only be moved six to eight lines long, and advances or retreats by means of a return screw, with very fine threads, the head of which can be seen in c. When the movable point has been set approximately at the desired spacing, the division is sought with the greatest accuracy, by turning the return screw c to the right or to the left, which having its nut in the same yard, move the box forward or back. Fig. 6 shows two conical or mushroom tips, which take the place of ordinary tips when needed. These kinds of compasses are of very convenient use in mechanics, and when exact divisions are to be made.

  Fig. 7 shows a quarter-circle compass, with several spare tips for different uses. This compass is usually made of steel, or at least the points must be steel. On one of the branches is a quarter circle, the center of which is in the middle of the compass head. This quarter-circle passes through the thickness of the other limb, which is held at the desired point 011 by means of a flat-head screw, which presses on the quarter-circle. We can adapt different kinds of points to this compass,

Pl. 1

such as copper cutting tip a, mushroom b, knife c, for cutting paper or cardboard, as shown apart between the branches of the compass.

  Fig. 8 shows an ordinary steel compass.

  Fig. 9 is a compass similar to the previous one, except that it has a quarter circle and a set screw towards its head.

  Fig. 10 is another quarter-circle compass with set screw.

  Fig. 11 is a compass similar to the previous one, except that the quarter-circle is toothed, and meshes with a pinion, having on the outside a flattened head like that of a screw. By turning this pinion to the right or to the left, you bring the branches of the compass closer or apart, to bring them to the point you want. A flat head screw, on the face opposite the head of the pinion, presses on the quarter circle, and fixes it at the point where it was put.

  Fig. 12 is a steel compass with a protruding head. As it tends to move apart, you only need to tighten or loosen the nut shown in it to move the branches apart or closer together.

  Fig.13 is a spring compass like the previous one; but it has a special use. When you want to adjust one part to another, a cover on its canister, or any other part that receives another, we take the spacing or internal diameter with the compass, fig.13; then taking the outer distance of the latter, with the tips of that,

  fig. 14, we are sure to give the part we have to turn the exact size it needs; or else, having taken the size of this piece with the compass, fig. 14, and adjusting the compass, fig. 13, to the size of the first, we are sure to give the piece which enters the other the diameter which suits him.

  Fig. 15 shows a thick compass, known as a dancing-master, because it has its legs out. Here is its use: the upper part takes the diameter o

u the size of a post, a case throat, a snuff box; and without disturbing anything, the spacing of the two legs gives the inside diameter.

  Fig. 16 is a compass roughly similar to the previous one, except that it also takes the thickness of the top and bottom. But it has a particular use, which it is fitting to make known. Suppose we want to know the thickness of a part in its middle, when its edges should be thicker; if you remove the compass from the place you want to measure, the greater thickness of the edges will necessarily move the compass away from it.

---
Page 4 TURNER'S MANUAL,
Pl. 1

So just take the thickness just from the place you want to measure, and the spacing of the two lower branches will give this thickness, if the compass is correct. We will say, in a moment, by what inconvenience it might not be.

  Fig. 17 is another caliper, the head of which is spring-loaded, and which is brought closer or apart, by tightening or loosening the nut.

  Fig. 18 is a compass intended for the same use as the previous one, except that the head is hinged, that it bears a quarter of a circle on which we fix the branch where we want, by means of a pressure screw which one supposes here to be from behind, and which opens more than the preceding one.

  Fig. 19 is the same as the previous one, except that the quarter of a circle is toothed, and that it moves by means of a pinion. It also has a set screw to be fixed wherever you want.

  Fig. 20 is another compass, which because of its shape is called Figure Eight. It has the same effect as that in fig. 16. The means of verifying the accuracy of compasses of this kind, which mark the top and bottom thickness, is to make one of the branches make a half-revolution, so that the point a, fig. 20, comes to join that c ; if the two branches thus changed, are of equal length, and that they touch, by one and the other end, as one supposes that they touched before, one can be assured of its correctness: in here is the reason. Equal circles must have equal radii. So if the point a, which turns on the center e, has for radius the straight line a e, a e is the radius of a circle equal to the radius e c, and we will be sure that the circles will be equal. If on the contrary the radius e c were smaller than that a e, the two circles would not be equal, and consequently the opening a b would never be equal to that c d.

  Fig. 21 is another compass with crayfish legs; it is built on the same principles as that in fig. i 5; but as it is often impor tant to fix a measure which should not vary, at one of the two branches is a notch which is a portion of a circle, the center of which is in the middle of the head of the compass, and the another is tapped to receive a scalloped head screw, and having a base which presses against the notched branch. Before putting the screw in place, we will make sure of the correctness of the legs with the claws, by presenting them to each other, as we said when talking about fig. 20.

Pl.2
  Fig. 1, Pl. 2, is a compass roughly the same as the previous one. The way to fix the spacing makes all the difference. It’s a screw

whose steps take in a bulge a, taken on one of the branches of the compass: it passes smoothly into another bulge also taken on the other branch. But since these two bulges are fixed, the two legs cannot deviate much, since in movement, these two bulges describe a portion of a circle, which the screw does not allow.

  Instead of the swellings a, b, we can put two pitons with turned and polished shanks, which enter into the thickness of the branches, and rest by a very wide shoulder on the branch. We bank the tail cleanly on the other side, interposing a counter-rivet against the branch, which is only a small washer of steel or copper, well drawn on both sides. In this way, when the branch pulls apart, the eyebolts rotate on themselves, and by this means the screw maintains its direction.

  Fig. 2 represents a kind of thick compass, very useful, when a part has a certain length, which we want to be sure of exactly. It is a steel rule, to one of the ends of which is fixed a doll, the end of which, ending in a rather loose point, is curved towards the length of the rule: another doll slides on the rule, of the same way as that of a Watchmaker's Tour. This doll is, like the other, terminated in a sort of claw absolutely similar to the first, and touching it exactly when it is pushed against it. A long screw, with a gadrooned head, rolls in the stationary headstock, by means of a collar which enters it gently. At the bottom of the head of the screw is a shoulder which bears against the headstock, and one threads in this screw a smallthis steel washer, which comes to rest against this same headstock inside: it is retained there by means of a pin, which passes through the screw, according to its diameter, so that the screw, once in place, cannot to advance nor to retreat. The other doll is pierced with a threaded hole, through which the screw passes, which in this way brings it closer to and away from the stationary one, depending on whether you are turning to the right or to the left. Below the mobile headstock is a pressure screw, which, by pressing against the bar, fixes the headstock very firmly in place.

  Fig. 3 is a very ingenious gauge for taking internal and external diameters. Two movable dolls have a ruler four to six inches long at their top. This rule is divided over its width by half; and on its thickness, this same rule is filed down to the line that has been drawn along its length, outwards by one end, and inwards by the other. Thus, when we have taken an external spacing by the points a, a, it is ensured that the internal diameter is determined by the

---
Page 6 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl 2.
points b, b, since the line for both measures is the same. We adapt, to one end of the rule or rod of this compass, a return screw, to operate more sensitive movements than would be done by hand, by sliding the other doll: finally, below each doll is a set screw to fix it where you want.

  Fig. 4 represents a square with a coping. A rule applied to the side of one of the branches of the square is called a chaperone. We apply this rule or chaperone against one of the faces of the part on which we want to draw lines square, or square, as the workers say. We will not go into the details of the construction of this instrument here; we will be satisfied to observe that if the rule is not well drawn up, and parallel on its two interior planes, the tool is worth absolutely nothing.

  Fig. 5 is an ordinary steel square. Such an instrument seems not to be very expensive; but if one wants to have a very exact one, one must necessarily put a certain price on it: unless one has made them oneself, one cannot be convinced of all the difficulty one experiences in making them good, and all the time required for this operation.

  Fig. 6 is a T-square. This instrument is of the greatest use in an infinite number of circumstances, and particularly when one wishes to drill a hole perpendicular to a surface.

  Fig. 7 is one of the most convenient instruments for the Lathe, and for various works of mechanics. It is called a sliding square. Its use is much more extensive than that of the T-square, the application of which is limited. When it comes to digging a lathe a box, and you want to make sure that the inside sides are perpendicular to the bottom, you should have as many T-squares as you want to make boxes of different depths; in short, the T-square can only be used when its branch A can pass through the hole, so that the rule B, C, rests on its edges. Instead of pressing the edges of the box ', ruler A, B, of the sliding square, and sliding that C, D, until the end of part D touches the bottom of the box or the hole, we approach it against the side, and we see if it is square. The vertical ruler C, D, is divided, which makes it easy to determine the depth of the box and the hole. This square can also be used to make the bottom of a box parallel to its outer surface; by walking the vertical ruler from the center to the circumference, it is easy to see the roughness that may be encountered there.

  This instrument, of the greatest utility, must be executed with great precision, if exact results are to be obtained.

  Fig. 8 is a gauge for putting pieces of equal thickness from end to end. The tailstock A is fixed at the appropriate point by means of the pressure screw which is below. This piece is called Caliber Thickness. There are of these calibers whose two dolls are movable. One is moved by a return screw, like the dolls of the com pas à verge. The other is sliding, as in the compass fig. 8.

  Fig. 9 is a false square or grasshopper. Branch B rotates at point a, as on a center, and is lodged between the two steel binoculars, of which branch A is formed. We move it away at will, depending on the inclination of the angle we want to draw. This instrument is of the greatest utility for mechanical fitters.

Pl.3.
  Fig. 1, PL 3, is a movable square, like that in fig. 7, PL 2, but whose vertical rule can tilt up to 45 degrees; which gives the means of determining the various interior inclinations.

  Fig. 2 is a very convenient compass for measuring the thickness of a part of which the opening ist very narrow, and which is swollen at the edges. The arched branch embraces the outside as the straight rod enters the hole; the other end of the compass gives by its spacing the thickness of the point where it was fixed.

  Fig. 3 is a copper compass with spare steel tips, quarter circle and return screw. This highly reinforced compass is very suitable for cutting and scribing on hard materials, such as iron, steel, and other metals; and it is the one that workers employ the most frequently.

  Fig. 4 is a copper or steel compass, the branches of which pass over each other, and carry the tips in and out at will. This compass is thus used to measure the parts internally and externally.

  Fig. 5 is a newly perfected copper gauge with two branches; one mobile A, fits into the stationary one B. The mobile branch is moved by a screw C, which recalls the end of the stationary branch B. By turning this screw, we move forward or 011 backward the scribe D , of the doll E, which is applied against the surfaces on which we trace. Branch A is divided to be able to fix it more exactly to the distance that we want to have. This precious instrument combines elegance of form with accuracy.

  Fig. 6 is a standing gauge. A cylindrical rod B is mounted on the steel plate A, which must be perpendicular to the plate A. On this rod runs a doll C, which is fixed at the desired height, by means of a pressure screw F. C It is this doll which carries the point JJ, being used to trace on the part of the lines parallel to the surface posed on the plate.

  This tool is much superior to other scribes with which we can only draw parallels to an already erected surface. With it, on the contrary, we can do it, whatever the shape of the surfaces; if even the part were too large to place it on the plate, the same result would be obtained by placing it on a marble, on a mirror, or on any other exactly flat surface. It would then be necessary to turn the point D out of the plate, which one would slide on the marble or on the ice, so that the point would flow along the face of the part.

  Fig. 7 is a vernier caliper, in copper, formed of two rods, one of which A is hollow, and receives the one B. When the second is fully inserted into the first, the instrument has a whole length of six inches, six to nine lines, which can be gradually increased to one foot, by making the movable rod come out of the hollow rod; which gives the means of measuring much more accurately and much more easily than with the hinged foot. These feet are adjusted and divided much more carefully, and don't have the disadvantage of hinged feet, which easily break where the two legs meet. These feet are usually marked with the decimal division on one side and the former in inches and lines on the other.

  Fig. 8 is a copper gauge foot, formed, like the previous one, of two rods, one of which enters the other; at the end of each there is a steel spout, by means of which all parts up to five inches in diameter can be measured internally or externally. The total development of these two stems gives a length of one foot. One of the faces is divided into inches and lines, and the other bears the decimal division. the opening we need.

  Fig. 9 represents a kind of sliding compass, which we will call the comparator compass.

  It is formed of three copper blades; two are fixed at A, on one

---
Page 9 CHAP. I. Sect. I. Compasses, Calibers, Squares.
Pl.3.

pointed heads, and leave between them a space in which flows the third blade which is a little thinner than the other two, and on the length of which a groove is made, the end of which can be seen at b.

  At the other end of this inner blade is attached the second head B, to which are fitted two copper cheeks C, D, which slide along the thickness of the outer blades with which they are flush on both sides. The small bolt seen at the lower end of the split blade is used to secure the inner leg, and therefore head B, at the set point of separation. On both sides of this compass are engraved the following measurements: i °. the king's foot; 2 0. the foot of the Rhine; 3 °. the English foot; 4 °. the circumference of the circle whose diameter we know, calculated on the Archimedes ratio, that is to say from seven to twenty-two. ;

  In the description of this compass, we have followed the model that we have in front of us, and which was entrusted to us by a distinguished Amateur; but we feel that he would beeasy to substitute any other measure for the first three: for example, the metric foot instead of the English foot, etc. We could also, for the fourth, use the ratio of 113 to 355 found by Adrien Métius, and which is even more exact than that of 7 to 22

  The two cheeks C, D, have on each of their two faces a division similar to the nonius of graphometers, and the use of which is roughly the same.

  This division has nine lines of the measurement drawn on the corresponding part of the face, divided into ten equal parts. At the point where this division begins is drawn a zero cut along its length by a small bar. When this little bar is not directly in front of a division indicating a line, we find how many tenths of a line it is away from it, by counting the divisions of the nonius up to the point where one of its divisions coincides. with one of those of the rule.

  The uses of this instrument are quite numerous; it serves :

  1 °. Compare the three measures engraved on it with each other. If, for example, we want to know how many inches and lines of the foot of the Rhine are 3 inches 4 leagues, king's foot, we pull branch B until the zero bar, an indicator of the nonius placed opposite -screw the spoke foot, is located opposite 3 inches 4 rows. We turn the compass over, and we see that the zero indicator of the nonius placed opposite the foot of the Rhine indicates as a corresponding value, 3 inches 5 lines 4 tenths.

---
Page 10 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.3.

  It would be the same if we wanted to compare together the other measurements traced on the faces of this compass.

  2 °. From thick camps for all round, flat or square parts. All you have to do is grab the part between the two steel arms, A, B, and the zero indicator of any measurement will indicate the thickness or diameter of the part.

  3 °. To measure the depth of a hollow part, a rebate or any ledge on a round or straight part. To do this, you have to bring out the entire inner branch, press it against the bottom of the hollow, and lower the outer branches until their end touches the upper edge. Leading zeros will mark the amount the first branch entered.

  4 °. Indicate immediately and without trial and error, to within a tenth of a line, the circumference of a circle whose diameter we know. For example, if we want to know what is the circumference of a circle whose diameter is s inches 7 lines, we put the zero indicator of the nonius of the king's foot with respect to this dimension, and the zero indicator of the nonius , corresponding to the division drawn on the same slide, indicate for the circumference 8 inches 1 line 4 tenths.

  We will observe here that the circumferences are calculated for diameters of which we know the dimensions in parts of the king's foot. Consequently, if the given diameter were composed of aliquots of the foot of the Rhine or other, it would first have to be reduced to inches or lines of the king's foot, and to see on the line of the circumferences the corresponding number, which would then be reduced. in aliquots from the foot of the Rhine. These reductions are made by means of the instrument, and present no difficulty.

  5 °. Finally, to immediately point out on paper the measures taken by the methods just described, so that they can be used if necessary. This advantage is not the least of those presented by the comparator compass, and the Hobbyist who wants to run or design a machine, or reduce it proportionally, will feel the full cost.

  But we will add here that the merit of this instrument depends entirely on the correctness of the divisions and the precision of its adjustment; and we urge those who obtain a similar one to check it carefully before using it.

  The groove of the inner branch can be cut in the shape of a rack. Then, by means of a pinion placed at the end of the outer branches, it is moved forward or backward more easily. This adjustment

---
Page 11 CHAP. I. Sect. I. Compasses, Calibers, Squares.
Pl.3.

is as good as the one we described; however, there are cases where the thickness of the pinion may interfere. Moreover, the movement is a little slow, and we believe we should preferably recommend the first method, which is simpler and takes less time.

  An instrument of this kind, on which, instead of the different measures of which we have spoken, only one would be engraved on each side, such as the king's foot, and the development of the circumferences with nonius indicating twentieths. of line on one side, and of the twenty-fourths on the other, divisions easy to distinguish with the naked eye, would be of an invaluable utility in the practice of the sciences and the arts.

  Fig. 10. represents the reduction compass formed of two copper rulers A, A, bearing an open groove along their length, et terminated by two steel points B, B, b, b. These two blades are joined by a bolt C, which passes through two slides placed in the grooves.

  By means of this adjustment we can slide the bolt in the grooves, and thus change the point of rotation.

  This compass is very frequently used by people who take pride in working with precision. Its construction provides the means to reduce or increase a drawing without having to continually use scale. Indeed, if we bring the bolt C at the end of the groove on the side of the points B, the center of rotation is just in the middle of the distance between the points j5, b, and consequently the opening of the points B, B, is equal to that of points b, b. A. As we move the center of rotation towards b, b, the opening between ô, ù, will decrease proportionally compared to that B, B.

  One of the rulers has a division in 24, and the other in 20; which makes it easy to reduce a drawing to half, third, quarter, fifth, etc., by placing the center of rotation at half, third, quarter, fifth of the division drawn on the rules.

  Fig. 11 shows an instrument, with the help of which we can trace ovals by a continuous movement, and which we will therefore call the oval compass. Fig. 12 shows the profile. This instrument consists of a copper circle A, on which are fixed two copper rulers B and G, which intersect at right angles, in the center of the circle. Eight slides placed on these rulers form a dovetail groove on each one. Four are fixed, and four are movable, and adjusted with two or three screws that can be tightened as the part becomes loose.

Page 12 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.3.

  Two small steel slides, a, a slide very closely in these grooves, and are surmounted by two copper or steel boxes C and F, fig. 11 and fig. 12. Box C is attached to the end of the square steel rod D, and the other slides over that same rod. Both are fitted on the two small steel slides a, a, so that they can turn freely.

  A pressure screw b crosses the top of the movable box F, and stops it on the square rod, at the necessary point.

  Rod D is made up of two pieces of steel joined by a hinge at point d. A box 27, in which the pencil, the pencil or the scribe is fixed, slides along this rule from the hinge to its end, and stops at the point where it is desired to be fixed, by means of '' a pressure screw e.

  When, using this instrument, we want to draw an oval of which we know the major and the minor axis, we start by determining the difference between these two lines. The moving box F is then moved away from the fixed box C, so that the points on which these two boxes rotate are separated from each other by half of this difference. Slide the box with the scribe on the square rod, until it is away from the center of rotation of the stationary box C, half the length of the major axis. To facilitate these operations, the square yard D has a division in inches and lines, starting from the point of rotation of the box C. Thus, for example, if we want to draw an oval whose major axis is four inches, and the small three inches, we place the center of rotation of the movable box F with six lines, and the scribe two inches from the point of rotation of the box C. If, as happens quite usually, the oval that we want to trace in a given direction on the part, we must place 1 instrument so that the groove B is in the prolongation of the major axis, and consequently the groove G in the direction of the minor axis.

  In this state and after having firmly stopped the boxes F and E, by means of the pressure screws c and e, one makes walk the rod D with the right hand, by pressing the thumb of the left hand on the button of the fixed box C, which for this purpose is slightly concave. Circle A bears, moreover, on its lower surface three or four small points of steel, which help to fix it very firmly.

  As we rotate the rod D, we see the slides a, a, successively run through the four grooves, always keeping their

---
Page 13 CHAP. I. Sect. I. Compasses, Calibers, Squares.
Pl.3.

distances. When the stationary box E has reached the center, the verge D is in the direction of the major axis, and the scribing point is as far as possible from the center of the instrument. Still continuing to turn the rod, the stationary box moves away from the center \ and the mobile box F approaches it. When it has reached this point, the rod is in the direction of the minor axis, and r the scribe is closer to the center, by the distance between the points of rotation of the boxes.C and F. So it is clear that the oval drawn by this operation meets the conditions proposed.

  It is good to observe that one could not draw with this compass, an oval whose small axis would be shorter than the diameter of the circle of copperplate on which the instrument is mounted.

  This disadvantage does not exist in the oval compass fig. i 3, the main advantage of which is that you can reduce the minor axis as much as you want, and even reduce it almost to zero. At this point, the oval is just a straight line. By successively increasing the minor axis, and always leaving the major axis of the same length, we obtain all the possible ellipses until the two axes are equal, which gives the circle.

  It is true that with this compass we only draw half of the curve; but by repeating the same operation on the other side, without changing anything in the arrangement of the instrument, it is finished in an instant.

  This compass is mounted on a sort of T-shaped square, formed of the two rulers A, A and B, N, each of which carries a square steel rod a, a, fixed on pillars placed at their end, and which, isolate them from the rules, as can be seen in the section fig. 14.

  The rod resting on the rule B, N, is perpendicular to the other, but it does not touch it, and thus allows passage to the box C, which flows over it. A similar box D, slides over the other rod, and each of these boxes is surmounted by a steel ring F} which pivots by means of its adjustment, as shown in fig. 14.

  These two rings are crossed by the rod G, intended to carry the copper barrel H, which receives the scribe. A small coil spring, placed in the interior of the barrel, allows the point to follow the unevenness of the surface on which one operates, and thus compensates for the hinge of the rod of the compass fig. 11.

  The barrel is fixed on a box which slides along the rod, and which is stopped at the necessary point by means of a set screw.

---
Page 14 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.3.

  The other end of the rod is fixed, in the ring of box D, which we will therefore call the fixed box.

  Figs. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 represent on a larger scale all the parts which form the boxes D and C, and the rings which surmount them.

  The way of drawing an oval with this compass has a lot to do with that which we have described in speaking of the duke compas jïg. 11. After determining the difference between the two axes, move the moving box C away from the fixed box D, until the distance between their points of rotation is equal to half of this difference. We then measure on the same yard a length equal to half of the major axis, from the point of rotation D, and we fix at this place the box which carries the scribe. To facilitate these various operations, the rod is divided like that of the compass fig. 11, starting from the point of rotation of the fixed box D.

  In this state we set the rule A, À, in the direction of the major axis, putting the steel point N i which indicates the middle of this rule, on the center of the valley, and we draw an undefined line. The scribe is made to walk starting from one end of the major axis, until it has reached the opposite end: at this point, the instrument is turned over, rotating it on the point iV, until the rule A, A, ends up in the same direction; which is. easy to verify by means of the indefinite line that we have drawn. Then we make the same path go on this side to the scribe, and thus complete the requested oval.

  Fig.15 shows a centering machine; this small instrument is in fairly frequent use, and it saves artists a lot of time and tedious operations, especially those who often find themselves needing to center small metal parts.

  We present the end of the part whose center we want to find, in the kind of funnel made on side A, and whose shape we can see, by means of the dotted lines. The center of the piece passes a cylindrical point a, which ends at the opening of the funnel, internally following the trace indicated by the dotted lines b b. A spring B presses on this point, so that it resists a little when the part is pushed in, until its circumference touches the inner walls of the funnel. A light blow of the mallet, struck directly above the point, marks the center sought very exactly.

  If you want to center a long piece, to put it back on the lathe; for example, a steel rod, on one of the ends of which a screw or any other piece would have been detached, and of which consequently one of the centers would be destroyed, it would be reestablished very seriously, and very promptly, at the same time. using this instrument.

  For this, we will use anpiece of iron pilaster, Fig. 16, bearing on one of its faces a point a, and over the entire height of the same face a series of conical holes of different diameters. A. the lower part of this pilaster is a wood screw b, with the help of which it is fixed on a point of the workbench, to the left and at a short distance from the vice.

  We will place the remaining center of the rod on the point of the pilaster-, and we will approach, with the left hand, our instrument, the end we want to center, until the inner wall of the funnel touches the edges. of the rod. Then, putting this rod in motion, by means of a bow and a brass, which must be fixed to it, the hole will be milled in an instant, so as to be able to insert the point of the Tour into it.

  The use of the pilaster, Fig. 16, is not limited to the operation just described. It is also useful when we want to drill very straight and very fine holes in delicate parts. For this purpose we place the end of a copper drill, fig. 29, PL. n, T. I, in-one of the holes in the face of the pilaster; and presenting the piece with the left hand at the point, the drill is set in motion with a bow. As the drill enters, the workpiece is advanced to the right, keeping it in exactly the same direction until the hole is deep. In the event that the part is so delicate that it is not easy to hold it with the fingers, it will be gripped in a pair of pliers, or in a hand vise.

  If we had to drill, in the direction of its axis, a straight piece of a certain length, it would be better to mount a brass on the piece, and place it itself on the pilaster, holding the drill bit. the left hand. In this way we would be more sure to drill straight. In the latter case, too, we must not fail to turn the part over, when we have reached the halfway point, to start drilling again from the other end, as we taught in Volume 1, page 236.

*** SECTION II Hand vices y Parallel vices.

 Among the instruments described in this section, and shown on Plate 4, there is 'not one that can be done without in a laboratory'. Although their form and their use are generally known to artists who use them daily - particularly watchmakers, we thought we would please amateurs by giving them the figure and description.

 Fig. 1, Pl. 4, shows a small plate vice, which can be fixed perpendicularly 1 to the front of the workbench, by means of screws placed in the holes a and b, drilled at the ends of the plate A. can also, and this is his; main advantage, fix it horizontally on the workbench using the same screws, and a third, placed in the hole c, drilled at the end of the tail *; finally, if we were to use the horizontal vice often, we would fix it in the same way on a flat piece of wood, which we grasp between the jaws of an ordinary vice, or under a valet. Qn will frequently meet, in this Yoiume, operations in which this vice is involved! a granule useful for piercing or cutting copper or steel pieces, for cutting scales into blades, etc. etc.

 Fig. 2 is a. Hand vice, with pointed jaws, the use of which is to grasp the small iron or steel rods that you want to round, or to square with the file.

 The ordinary cross-jaw hand vise, Fig. 3, is too well known to need to stop there.

 Fig. 4 is a sliding pliers with pointed jaws, mainly used to make pins. For this purpose, it has a perpendicular groove in the middle of its jaws, in which you can grasp the object you are working on. Slider A slides over the two branches, and it is lowered as much as necessary to firmly clamp the part placed between the jaws.

 The slip clamp, fig. 5, .me .differs from the previous one only by the shape of its jaws, which are transverse. It carries between its two branches, as well as the previous one, a spring similar to that of the vices, which opens the jaws as the flow is raised.

 Figs. 6 and 7 represent two very small hand vices, which are used for

 same use as clamps 4 and 5. But as their jaws are much smaller, they are suitable for gripping the most delicate parts, such as extremely thin pins, which one would easily make with the small vice, fig. 7, and which one could not grip conveniently with the pliers, fig. 5, and still less with the vice, fig. 3, although their jaws are all similar in form, and differ only in their size. In general, the tool should be proportionate to the object it grasps; and this is why we again give the needle holders, fig. 8, and 8 bis, with which we can grasp the thinnest needle to thread the end or to make a small drill. The handle of fig. 8 bis is additionally pierced along its length and in the direction of its axis; which gives the means of grasping between the jaws the longest part, of which only the part on which we operate is allowed to exceed. Note also in the figure the shape of the jaws, which is extremely convenient for gripping the shortest screws without damaging the head, which is placed in the notch a.

 Fig. 10 shows the flat pliers used to straighten warped parts, to tighten links, and for an infinite number of other uses.

 The round pliers, Fig. 11, are in use for turning rings, hooks, etc., and serves as a key in many circumstances.

 Fig. 12 is a pair of end cutters suitable for cutting medium-sized metal wires.

 Fig. i 3 represents another cutting pliers, called Side cutting pliers, the edges of which are inclined, in relation to the branches, and with which one can cut in the interior of a hole, where the pliers, fig. 12, do not could penetrate.

 The flat cutting pliers, _ / £ § ■. 14, combines the effect of the clamp, fig. 10, and that of fig. i 3; but frequent use soon puts it out of service.

 Fig. 9 represents two species of false spring jaws, which are
 place in an ordinary vice, when you want to insulate a delicate part.
 Watchmakers use it to shade the wheels and rivet the smallest ones
 pins.

 The long nose pliers, fig. i 5, is suitable for entering the smallest objects
 to wear them in their place. Watchmakers use it to assemble and disassemble the smallest parts.

 All the clamps and all the vices shown on PL 4 do not have a fixed and determined size. They are made from three inches to six inches, and their size is always in proportion to their length.

 Everyone knows the instrument called the vise, the use of which is essential in all the arts which have some analogy with the Art of the Turner, and which must therefore be an essential part of an Amateur's laboratory. We will not speak here of ordinary vices, either on foot or with claw, the mechanism of which is too well known, and we will content ourselves with describing the following ones, which have received notable improvements in their construction.

 Fig. 1, PL 5, shows in profile a claw vice called a roller vice, which differs from the ordinary vice only in the way in which the movable jaw is fitted to the jaw attached to the workbench.

 Fig. 2 shows the same vice seen from the front. B, B, are two kinds of curved ears which terminate the fixed jaw, and between which is placed the roller A, which belongs to the mobde jaw. This roller is drilled in the direction of its length, and crossed by a bolt with round head C, which also passes through the two ears, and is fixed in this position by a hexagonal nut. This adjustment is stronger than that of ordinary vices, in which the movable jaw quickly takes up play and spreads to the right or to the left, instead of coming to rest exactly against the fixed jaw.

 The parallel vice, fig. 3, is very convenient for cutting wood, and in general for gripping pieces of a certain width. This vice differs mainly from the previous one, in that the movable jaw P, instead of forming, by opening, an angle with the other jaw L, moves away from it, and approaches it by a parallel movement, at the means of the adjustment that we are going to describe. A is the box which, as in the previous one, receives in a nut made in its interior the screw B, which brings near its base a groove equal to the thickness of the plate, or crescent C, seen flat, fig. 4. This crescent is fixed by its lower part to the movable jaw P, by means of one or two screws, and its two branches embrace the screw, filling the groove just mentioned. By means of this adjustment, the screw drives the movable jaw when the vice is opened.

 So that this movement always takes place in a straight line, and so that the two jaws keep their parallelism, the mobile jaw P carries at its lower end a strong flat ruler D, perpendicular to its axis. This ruler flows into an opening or box formed at the end of the other jaw by two cheeks, one of which can be seen at E, and by a false ruler F, the extension of which serves to guide the

 ---
 Page 19 CHAP. I. Sect. II. Hand vices; Parallel vices.
 Pl.5

parallel rule D, when the two jaws are brought together. A small cylinder placed at point G, between the two cheeks, and rotating on its axis, decreases the effect of friction at this point, and makes the movement smoother during pressure.

 Besides the parallel movement, this vice still has the ability to turn on itself, which is very useful in an infinite number of circumstances. For this, the jaw Z /, instead of being fixed to the workbench, as in an ordinary vice, is placed in a copper collar, half of which H is embedded on the front of the workbench, and s' fixed there by means of a few wood screws. The other half, Fig. 5, connects to the first with two screw bolts.

 Fig.6 is the same half seen from the end, and Fig.7 is the profile; a, a, are the bolts we just talked about. It is in the collar formed by the union of these two parts that the jaw L rolls, which, for this purpose, is cylindrical towards the middle of its height. When we want to move the vice, we loosen one of the bolts a, a, and when we have brought it to the necessary point, we fix it by tightening the bolt again. To give the parallel vice more strength, a foot is often added to it, which is screwed into the axis of the Z jaw, by means of a nut made at the end of this jaw.

 The kneeling vice, fig. 8, not only has, like the previous one, the faculty of opening parallel, and of moving circularly; but in addition, it may incline forward, and thus form, with the plane of the ground, an angle more or less open above ninety degrees.

 The movable jaw A opens by means of a recall similar to that of the preceding one; but the nut which receives the screw C, instead of being in a box, is made in the interior of the jaw B. A circular brush, fixed in key to the same jaw, stops the dirt which could enter in the steps of the nut. This vice being of a small dimension, and the parallel rule being very close to the screw, we removed there, as useless, the roller which, in the preceding one, serves to facilitate the movement of the rule D.

 The circular movement is obtained by means of the following mechanism. The jaw B has at its base a circular plate seen at E, fig. 9, which represents the vice from the front. This plate has a number of teeth around its circumference which are used to stop it by means of a wormrou a, fig. 10, fixed to the portion of a copper circle G, fig. 8, which we are going to talk about. A rod F, placed in the axis of the jaw B, crosses this

 ---
 Page 20 TURNER'S MANUAL.
 Pl. 5.

 portion of a copper circle. The excess portion of this rod passes into a hexagonal washer, and ends with a thread which receives the nut a.

 This portion of circle G, fig. 8, front view, fig. io, is the part that gives the vice the ability to tilt towards the workbench. A strong pin placed at point E crosses the two cheeks of the claw //, and the portion of circle G placed between these two cheeks, and serves as an axis for the movement by which this last part comes out more or less from the straddle in which it is contained. A pawl M is pushed by a spring into the teeth made around its circumference, and thus fixes the vice to the degree of inclination required.

 The main advantage of this vice is to present in all directions the part which is gripped between its jaws, and thus give the Amateur the ability to file a beveled part without changing the position of the file, which always remains horizontal. ; an invaluable advantage for people who, like watchmakers, work seated in front of their workbench.

 The knee vice, Fig. 11, has all the properties of the previous one, but the construction is simpler.

 The adjustment of the screw C, and the parallel rule D, is absolutely the same. As for the rod placed in the extension of the axis of the jaw B, we see in F, fig-12, that it is much longer. The tooth plate is removed, and the rod enters the socket E, fig. 11 and 13. In this last fig., We see from the front the socket and the claw serving to fix the vise to the workbench: with regard to the jaws, they have been left in the same position as in fig. 11, to make the description clearer and easier. We see in G, fig. 11 and 13, the washer with sides, and the nut which mounts on the end of the rod which exceeds the socket. The nut is winged, which provides a way to loosen and tighten it, to secure the vise when it has been brought to the proper point.

 Figs. 14 and 15 represent these last two parts, seen flat.
 Fig. 17 is the plan of the socket E, fig. 11 and 13.

 All that remains for us to describe is the mechanism which gives this vice, as with the previous one, the ability to tilt in front of the workbench. The main part is an iron semicircle L, fig. 11 and 1 3, to which is fixed, by means of two screws, the sleeve E which carries the vice. This semi-circle is fitted to the ZZ claw, which secures the vice to the workbench with a round rod that passes through the claw, and is held there by a nut placed behind it.

 Fig. 16 shows this part seen in profile. Rod a is at the

 Pl.5

 center point of the semicircle, and it is at this point that the circular movement takes place which gives the inclination to the vice. The circumference of the semi-circle has a small rebate which slides between the back of the claw and the plate or brake K, fig. 11 and 13. The shank bolt S, same figures, crosses this plate and is mounted with a screw in a nut made in the thickness of the claw: thus, when this bolt is tightened, the plate presses on the rebate of the semi-circle, and therefore stops the vise in the position it was placed, as firmly as the spring loaded pawl in the vise, fig. 3.

  We taught, in the first Volume, how to make screws with wood dies; but we thought it necessary to reserve, for this second Volume, the description of the carpenter's tap and the large-scale dies, to which we will add some details on smaller dies, but the more complicated construction of which could have embarrassed beginners.

 Fig. 1 shows a broken die, the body of which is made up of two parts, joined together along their length. It is very useful in small diameters, where sometimes the wood, having little consistency, breaks in the threaded part, and one does not know how to get the piece back without damaging the die. We see by the line c c, fig. 2, the junction of the two parts which are joined together, by means of two bolts shown separately at A A, fig. 1, which pass through the thickness of the die. We xoï \., Fig.3, these two separate parts; and fig. 4, the plate or guide, in one piece, which is fixed to the die, by means of the four wood screws b, b, b, b, fig. 2.

 The V of the die has been shown on its three faces: at C, above, to show its triangular groove; in D, from below, to show the two bevels, whose meeting forms the apex of the angle, and from the side in E, to make one of the bevels sensitive, and the slope that the edge of the V must have. We see in d the way in which the V is placed in the die.

 Most workers are in the habit of tilting the V, relative to the sides of the die. This use is good when the die is very narrow, and there is only a little wood left between the notch and the edge: because if we made this notch in the wood grain, the edge could very easily

 ---
 Page 22 TURNER'S MANUAL.
 Pl.6

break ; but do not believe that this inclination has no influence on the position of the V, relative to the nut.

 The lower part of the V has, in its length, a straight line which intersects the circumference of the circle of the nut by a given and almost insensitive amount.

 Suppose that instead of being a kind of parallelogram, the die is a circle with two handles, whatever position we give to the V, we cannot say that we incline it more or less, then that we do not 'will have more comparison straight line to determine what is called Tilt. It will therefore suffice to bring the V more or less towards the center of the nut, depending on whether you want to take more or less wood.

 We are in the habit of inclining the V, in relation to the piece of steel, at the end of which it is formed, because if we left it perpendicular, it would cut into the wood at too great a depth, which would make the angle of the pitch of the screw too acute, and would form a fragile thread, and which would easily be grained. It is especially in large dies or in screws with very wide pitch that this drawback is noticed.

 Fig. 6, 7 and 8 represent a die for large screws, in which there are two Vs; the first, with a rounded angle, carries the wood to a shallow depth; and the second, to which we give the ordinary form, completes the formation of the net in all its depth and its spacing. Certainly, when a screw goes two and a half to three inches in diameter, it must win too much wood: the effort is too great, and the wood shatters instead of being cut alive. Instead of by means of both the one displacing a chip of an average size, and the second completing the removal of this wood with all the more ease, since the middle being hollowed out, the chips on both sides do not feel more resistance, and come closer in an empty groove.

 Fig.6 shows the die seen from above, and without its plate or guide. We see in a the first / Opiate at the beginning of the wash step, and in b the second placed at the other end of the same diameter, so that the perpendicular lowered from the middle of the first comes to fall at the same place on the second, passing through the center of the nut circle.

 The second, being intended to complete the pitch than the first blank, should have a little more protrusion on the thread of the nut.

 The two V's are attached in a much stronger and more convenient way than by means of the wood screws, which we discussed in detailing the dies in Volume 1. Each of them is held by an

 Pl.6
 iron hook that we have shown separately, y * g \ io, which passes through the thickness of the die, and whose bent part presses on the middle of the length of V. A cap nut, or simply with two notches, as seen in A, tighten the hook and the V. Fig.7 is the same die covered with its guide or plate fixed by two wood screws. Fig. 8 is the same die seen over its thickness. Finally, fig.9 is the plate or guide.

 Fig. 5 represente a tap. Figures A and B show the end of the threaded portion, and are intended to show the benefit of one of the two ways of crenellating it. Workers who work for no reason are content to practice on the tapped part, with a third point, triangular grooves that penetrate to the bottom of the teeth; but this notch, which presents the two sides of an equi lateral triangle, cannot release the material quickly enough as the wood starts to cut, instead when the notch is inclined, as we see in B, the chip comes out more easily and the pitch is formed with more regularity

 Fig. 11 shows a small tap of a particular construction, and to make the details more sensitive, the threaded part has been shown in much larger proportions, fig. 12. The pitches differ from those of other taps, in that the former have the largest diameter, and the others gradually decrease to the latter. The threaded part is preceded by a smooth part that is slightly larger than the diameter of the bottom of the pitch. The tap is hollowed out from the A end, a little more before the beginning of the first step, and reduced to a thickness line. The birth of the first step is cut off until the point where the thread begins to be at its thickness, so that the axis of the triangle formed by the cut falls perpendicularly to the axis of the cylinder. The edges of this cut have the shape of the V of a die, the very obtuse bevels of which are sharpened inside; below this kind of V a light is pierced which communicates with the hole made in the interior of the guide.

 When these taps are a little big, place a second V of the same shape as the first where the pitch is half its size. This second V produces the same effect as that used for large dies, and serves to outline the step that the first finishes.

 We feel that when we insert the cylindrical part into a hole, the end of the thread B cuts the wood, and that the pitch is formed, not by chipping

 ---
 Page 24 TURNER'S MANUAL.

 as with other taps; but that the wood is cut, as it is by the V of a die that forms the screw.

 This improved tool has great advantages over ordinary taps. It takes almost no effort to move it forward, and you don't have to pull it out to free it from the material, since the chip comes out through the lumen as it forms. Finally, with this tap, the wood never bursts, which often happens when using others.

 The only downside that can be found with its use is that since it has no entrance, it is quite difficult to get it taken. In truth, we could widen the hole we want to tap; but this is only practicable if we can then take this flared part away, either on the Tour or on the plane. Otherwise, you must glue On the part, before drilling it, a small wooden board five to six lines thick, to which the necessary flaring is given, and which will be removed when the nut is completed.

 We will do well not to neglect this precaution, when using the other taps, so that the surfaces of the hole are not scratched by the first steps. No one has noticed that the step is reversed towards the surface, and that the first step is never as clear as the others; this comes from the fact that nothing supports the wood against the faction of the tap.

 The example of iron dies, the bearings of which can come together, and make a larger or smaller screw, has prompted several artists to look for ways to adapt this practice to wood dies; but this method generally succeeds poorly, and requires an infinity of precautions, which disgust many people with it. Some artists have also imagined increasing the diameter of the tap at will, to give the screw the clearance it should have: some have split the tap along its length, so as to make it spring. They insert an iron wedge into the slot, which, by spreading the two halves apart, increases its diameter, and consequently that of the nut.

 The plate or guide, which is fixed on the die, having a well round hole, and concentric with the diameter of the nut, must drive the cylinder straight, and prevent it from jumping to one side or the other, s' it fills the hole exactly: but as it dries, it may have changed its shape even a little, one cannot of course count on this guide to maintain the cylinder in its direction. People who will want to work

 with very great accuracy, they will not be satisfied with priming the cylinder, as we see in fig. 16, and as the workers practice it; they will take care to make on the Lathe, at the end of the cylinder, a cylindrical part, fig.17, to the exact diameter of the nut: and to be sure, they will present the die itself to this cylinder, which must enter it just without forcing, so as not to spoil the steps. This part will be just under an inch long. Then we will give a slightly elongated conical shape, from this cylindrical part to the body of the cylinder. By this means, the large cylinder will be contained straight by the small one in the nut, and by the large one in the guide; and we will see the steps forming with the greatest regularity.

 Fig. 13 represents a kind of bit, very convenient for piercing in transverse wood the holes intended to be tapped. It is a kind of lantern, the two sides of which each have a bevel, in opposite directions. The pigtail screw you see at the bottom determines the bit to penetrate the wood, and you don't feel more strain than that of the material to be cut. The bottom a, b, of this bit also has two bevels in opposite directions; so that the material is cut, both standing and grain, so that the long sides go a little closer together from the bottom. There is shown, on a larger scale, fig. 14, the lower part of the same wick. We see the bevel of one side of the end at ", while the opposite part d is of a certain thickness, as we can see on the other side c, since the bevel is at b. We
 understand that the outer sides e, f, are rounded roughly along the curve of a circle of which g would be the center, and the two sides the circumference.

 It is necessary to give both sides of the lantern some strength, otherwise it will soon twist on itself. The shank can be as long as you want, depending on the length of the part you want to drill.

 We also make bits similar to those we have just described, except that they are solid instead of being hollowed out: the former release the chip more easily; but as they are more fragile, we should generally prefer the seconds.

 It would be difficult to tap with the taps just described a nut of a somewhat large diameter, such as from three inches to a foot, as is used in large machines. We would have to use levers of extraordinary length, and many

 Page 26 TURNER'S MANUAL.
 Pl. 7.

 people to get them to act. On the other hand, we cannot think of screwing up the industry; To form such a long line, it would take a piece of lumber of enormous length, and few workshops would be large enough to operate the levers.

 The tap that is used to make these large nuts is called Carpenter's Tap, Figs. 3 and 11, PI. 7. It is made up of two main parts, the cylinder, fig. 4, on which the propeller pitches are traced, and the false nut, fig. 1 and 2, which, in fig. 11, is replaced by the press A, B.

 We will start by describing how to make these different parts.

 A piece of wood suitable for making a cylinder of sufficient length and thickness will be placed on the Lathe, and it will be turned perfectly even from end to end. We will divide this cylinder along its length by parallels to the axis into six or eight equal parts, (the more divisions there are, the more exact and easier the operation will be). We will determine by points placed on these parallels, the space that each rule must occupy, and we will divide each of these spaces into as many parts as we made divisions along the length. To make no mistake, we especially mark the points that indicate the end of each rule.

 Starting from the end to the right of the cylinder and from the end of one of the lines drawn along its length, we will lead in pencil and using a flexible ruler, a line up to the angle on the left, which forms the first sub-division, with the division lengthwise; from there to the second, 'and so on; and when we have done a full lap, we will have arrived at the second main division. We will continue like this until the end; which will give a very exact propeller, which terminates about seven inches from the end of the cylinder. Take three inches on this smooth part to form a square head used to move the machine using a left-hand turn. The remaining four inches between the head and the base of the propeller form a collar, the use of which will soon be seen.

 Then take a steel blade 6 to 8 lines wide, 5 to 6 inches long. We will dent it a little fine, and we will mount it in a wooden file, fig. 5, so that there are no more than two lines that exceed this folder. It will be fixed there by means of three or four rivets, as seen in a, b, c, cl. This backrest is nothing more than a wooden rod, 9 to 10 inches long, split along its thickness, and the handle of which can be rounded, to be more conveniently held in the

 ---
 Page 27 CHAP. I. Sect. III. Wood chains; Carpenter taps.
 Pl.7hand. With this saw, we will follow the line marked on the cylinder, and the backrest will serve as a stopper so as not to penetrate further than necessary. It can be seen from the inspection of fig. l \, the rate of this propeller on the cylinder.

 We drill at A, according to the diameter of the cylinder, a hole of flat shape, and capable of containing a barley grain, fig. 6, which enters it very just, and is held by a wedge of wood, fig. 7. This barley grain is cut at an angle of sixty degrees; and when we operate on a piece of a somewhat large diameter, we give it the shape shown in fig. 8, side view, where we have elegant, as the Workers say, the rod, in order to not to be obliged to drill too large a hole in the cylinder, which would weaken it and make it incapable of resisting the effort it is making. The shoulder, which can be seen under the bevel, is used to bring in the barley grain, by striking with a repellent. Instead of leaving the top surface flat, we dig a face, and we reserve two bevels that will meet at the corner of the barley grain. By this means, the wood is cut; instead of a single barley grain, it would rather be scratched and scratched; and it is only by going very small, and over and over, that the inside of the pitches of a nut can be made smooth.

 The false nut is done in several ways. We will detail the two that are most in use. We take a piece of firm wood, such as service tree, service tree, and, failing them, walnut. It is given four square inches, if that's for a two-inch tap; five, if it's three, and so on, depending on the size of the tap. It is given a thickness of four times the height of the pitch of the propeller. After it has been properly trained with a varlope on each side, it is mounted on the Lathe in the air, using the universal chuck or any other suitable for this purpose; we draw in the middle two concentric circles, fig. x, the inside, the diameter of the cylinder that carries the barley grain, and the outside of the first, about an inch; we will then make a hole with the exact diameter of the first circle, and we will dig well perpendicular to the surface: this precaution is of the greatest importance. We will then deepen the line of the second circle, and we will remove all the wood A which is outside it. We will continue in this way, until the protruding part B is at least the height of one pitch of the propeller drawn on the cylinder. Fig.1 shows this finished part, and fig.2 shows the section through its thickness. A is the cylindrical hole; B is the faceplate, and D is the thickness left to the board. We will draw on the outside of the

 Pl.7

 cylindrical part of which a, a, is the diameter, a screw thread equal in all to those of the tap, and for this we will use the procedures we used to trace the propeller on the cylinder.

 We will then cut the cylindrical part B, following exactly this line, which will give a circular inclined plane, called Limaçon, which we have made noticeable in fig. i, and more, fig. i and 3. We take a piece of sheet metal, the thickness of the saw cut through which we deepened the propeller, and we give it the shape shown in fig. i; but the inner circle should be three good lines in diameter less than the opening of the hole. As for the outer circle, it must have exactly that of the cylindrical part. After having cut this ring, either with the Lathe or with a file, it is cut according to its diameter, from a to b. Seven holes of sufficient size will be drilled on this circle to accommodate medium-sized wood screws, and 8 to 12 lines in length. These holes will be milled, and the circle will be fixed on the inclined plane which ends part A, B. We see by the dotted line, fig.1, that the iron circle exceeds the inner circumference of the hole. It is this excess part which takes in the propeller traced on the tap.

 We will now teach how to make a nut with this tap.

 We start by making a hole the size of the cylinder, in the part where we want to form the nut: we pass the cylinder through it after having fully inserted the barley grain in its notch, as seen in B, fig. 3, where A is the base of a press, in the middle of which we want to make a nut. Then thread the false nut B in the pitch of the propeller, until it rests on the box spring. It is placed there squarely, and it is fixed there by means of four iron pegs a, a, the fourth cannot be seen here. These pegs are a kind of nail, the head of which is turned back to one side and a little strong, so that they can be removed by means of a crowbar, a kind of iron instrument, thinned by one end like a pliers, and the end of which is split, which is very convenient for pulling nails without effort and without breaking them. To be able to remove more easily these ankles which are only used instructural pieces, which there is no risk of splitting, they are greased a little with tallow. The cylinder is then advanced by turning it to the right; and when the barley grain is about to enter, it is pushed by the end opposite to the point, with the tip of a hammer or a flat piece of iron, until it exceeds even slightly the surface of the cylinder. Then putting a

 lever on the head of the cylinder, we turn it deftly left, and we feel that the barley kernel cuts into the wood, by means of what it is called by the guide. When we have arrived outside the piece of wood, which is easily seen by the cessation of resistance, we take care to empty the chips through the notch C, which communicates to a recess F, which we have taken care to make below the plate B, and which has for diameter a little more than that which must have the screw; then the cylinder is turned in the opposite direction, until the barley grain has come out of room A, like the first time; and we keep pushing the barley kernel down a little, and threading it back through the nut, until it is the correct size for the screw.

 When we judge by the length of which the barley grain has come out of the cylinder, after having pushed it several times, little by little, that the pitch of the nut must be deep enough, we remove all- the cylinder, and we try if the screw which must have been made first enters easily enough. If a little is needed, we will put the cylinder back in the conduit, and we will drive the barley grain a little, taking very little wood at a time, so that the nut is clearer and more smooth. It is good that the screw is rather tight than loose in its nut, since the wood, however dry it is, always pulls out a little, and one will remember to rub the screw with a little soap, and not fat, if it is of medium size. Now it is a matter of making the screw.

 If this screw does not have to go three inches in diameter, we will do it with the regular die, otherwise we will do it in the following way. We will turn a large cylinder, fig. 10. We will reserve a stronger head A, and a journal B. If this screw must undergo a great effort, like that of a strong press, we will garnish the head with two iron frets D, DE, so that the lever that we jiasse in the mortises B, E, do not split it.

 A hole will be drilled in the center of the head, suitable for receiving an iron bolt C, the head and collar of which are turned, and the square body, with a square hole to receive a key a, which prevents it from coming out when it is in place. We will divide this cylinder into eight, or better still, twelve parts along its length; the more the division is multiplied, the less the line of 1 helix will be subject to halt. We will determine how many turns the cylinder which is to make the nut has a thread in a measured space; and we will divide the length of the cylinder into as many parts, each of which is one turn of the pitch of the screw. We will subdivide each division into as many parts as we have placed around the circumference along the length;

 and with a pencil, wave the black chalk, we will draw the net in the way we have detailed above. We will then make a second line, in the middle of the distance, between each of the first, which will seem to double the screw. If you are not aware, or you are afraid of making a mistake, you will make one line in black and the other in red. We will then take a file saw, like the one in fig. 5, or else an ordinary saw; but the first is more certain. For the projection of the blade, give all the depth that the thread of the screw must have. We will therefore make, with this saw, a line of all its projection, following exactly the black or red line, as we will have determined. When this saw cut is made over the entire length of the propeller, as can be seen in a, a, ", a, a, we will take a mallet with a sharp clasp, and we will cut, little by little , all the wood, starting at about a good line near the cut we left, until near the bottom of the kerf, following an inclined line, which we marked at b, b, b, b ; and when we have thus roughed out the net on one side, we will do the same on the other; then, with a chisel that cuts
 very sharp, we will finish giving the fillet the shape it should have, by cutting, from the left line, to the bottom of the saw cut, and taking care not to see the chisels: this which will give the screw the shape we see in c, c, c; and to give it the finish, we will run a fine, half-round grater over all the surfaces, in order to remove the chisels that always appear a little. This is done by laying the cylinder on a workbench, where it stands by its own weight, if it is a bit strong; if not by securing it under a valet. It is not necessary to continue a started netto the end, constantly rotating the cylinder. We can clasp all the threads, on the same point of the circumference, as for example here at the vertices a, a, a, a, a, b, b, b, etc; then turning the cylinder a little, we will cut down in the same way the summits which appear.

 Usually, for Varins' screws, or as the workers say, for jacks, presses or heavy machinery, we take very healthy wild wood, alisier, and failing them sprig walnut; that is to say of log, and never of quarter, or finally of good elm. Carpenters make all their cylinders by the way, with great skill; but they never reach the perfection of those we do at the Tour.

 We will not give here the description of a press or of a press, they are pieces of frame or joinery that it is not of black subject to treat. We will just say that the part in

 which passes the screw with a strong press, and which is called Sommier, is made as seen in A, fig. 3. It is assembled in the two montans, by means of the fork that is at each end.

 We have seen that, in order to tap by the previous method, we have to fix the false nut on the part with four strong pegs, or with wood screws, if the part is small. These dowels, or these screws, leave holes, which spoil the part on which they are placed. On the other hand, it is inconvenient to remove the cylinder from within its conduit, which is often not very easy, especially to re-engage the barley kernel in the nut. Here is a very ingenious means of remedying both drawbacks, which was communicated to us by the late Hulot, a distinguished artist, and who, after having inherited his father's talents, had put his study into extending them. Again. Two somewhat strong wooden sleepers A, B, J: g. i1, exchanged through the middle, as we can see, are assembled by means of two wooden screws C, C, which enter square in part B, and the other end of which, partially tapped, enters a hole round drilled in part A, and is retained above, by means of the two nuts L, L, the shape of which can be seen better in fig. 14, which is part A, fig. 11, seen from above.
 Towards the edge of the indentation are small points a, a, and eye bolts b, ô, the pointed end of which takes in part D, which you want to tap. If you fear that the marks on the tips will spoil the part, you can leave none: they serve to prevent the tap from varying during the operation. The top of part A has a false nut in the middle of its length and width, like the one in fig. i, either applied over or taken from the song. The cylinder is similar to the previous one, except that it is much longer. Part B has a hole much larger than the cylinder, and tapped, as seen in c, c. Then turn a piece of wood, fig. 12, part of which, also threaded, enters the nut c, c, and bearing a bead F, of a slightly larger diameter which rests on the piece B. At center of this bead is a hole A, fig. 12, in which just enters the cylinder G, fig. 11. The edges F, F are fluted, so that this part which is shown in section, fg, can be more easily screwed and unscrewed as needed. i 5. When we want to try if the screw goes well in its nut, we unscrew the part F-, and as the hole which it discovers is much larger than the cylinder, even when the barley grain is advanced, we remove it. from its place, and it is easy to pass the screw fig. 16, and try it. Fig. 14 is, as we said, part A, fig. 11, view

 Above. We can see the two nuts L, L, and the false nut M. If the nut is not at its point, we replace part E, F, fig. ï i, in its nut, and we put the cylinder back in the guide, after having advanced the barley grain a little.

 Instead of the lever, which we have said we used to advance the tap, we can fit a wooden crank /, K, fig. x i; which provides continuous and more uniform movement; but this method is only good for small nuts. You should always use a lever for stronger parts, because of the resistance you experience.

 Fig. 16 is a screw for a carpenter's bench press, or a press for slitting or cutting large timber. The dimensions we have given it here indicate that it is the specific screw for the nut just described, and part D is a carpenter's bench leg. The head is furnished with a large iron hoop, which enters from the side of the screw, by force, and rests against a shoulder which is practiced in a, a. We bring a good wooden disc in 6, b, and we turn the whole on the same center.
 The circle and the head are drilled by the diameter of a hole, which receives the lever, doYou use it to clamp the jaw of the press against the workbench. And so that the front jaw can move away when unscrewing, we make a small groove c, c on the neck of the screw, into which there are one or two keys, which go through the thickness of the jaw. By this means, the screw has the ability to turn; but when we make it come back in front, it takes the jaw with it. We fix the hoop on the head of the screw with four good wood screws, a little long, of which we only see two here at d, d.

 We announced in our first Volume, page 439, that we would give here the figure and the description of a compound saw, more convenient and more useful in many circumstances than that described in this Chapter, and which is placed on the established of the Tour. This saw is the one shown in fig. i, Pl. 8, which is mounted on a particular workbench. A, is the top of this workbench; B, B, B, B, are the feet joined by the cross members C, C. Another cross member D, placed towards the middle of the height of the feet of

front and bent towards the back of the workbench, as seen in the figure, carries two straight and well polished steel rods, which serve as a guide for the saw: the upper part of these rods is fixed at the bottom of the workbench.

  E, E, are the two crossbars or saw arms, joined by the base G, which passes through the workbench.

  These sleepers carry at their ends two saw blades, fixed by iron return screws, which serve to tension them as needed.

  Fig. 5 shows one of these return screws and the end of the blade R on a larger scale. This blade, which is eighteen to twenty lines wide, is intended for straight and miter sawing. The other H blade is very narrow, and is used for round sawing on all diameters.

  J, J, are two crossbars linked together by two steel rods similar to those under the workbench, and serving, like the latter, as a guide to the saw. These last four pieces together form a movable frame, sliding dovetail on the K-pillar, leaning against the h-column.

  The lower cross member carries a square iron rod P, on which slides the copper doll O, below which is fixed a steel point, the use of which we will soon see.

  Column L is surmounted by a capital bearing an arc M, similar to that of a Tower. By pressing the foot on the pedal N, the saw is forced to descend; and by lifting it as if to turn, the arc brings it up, which provides a gentle back-and-forth movement that is not tiring.

  When we want to saw a piece in the round, we use, as we said, the narrow blade H. We slide the doll O on the bar P, the distance necessary so that the tip of the doll is in the center of the part, which is very easy, because the bar P has a division in inches and lines, so that if we want to make with a saw a round part six inches in diameter, it suffices to make slide the doll over the bar until the tip matches the point of the division that indicates three inches.

  With the workpiece thus fixed at its center, all that remains is to rotate it as the saw passes through. A little habit will soon learn to tune the movement of the foot with that of the hand; That is, to push the cut only when the saw is descending, and without ever forcing it.

---
Page 34 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.8.

  To saw a straight piece, we use the wide blade R: q is a movable square with a cheek running down the front of the workbench, to move more or less away from the blade R, and thus determine the width of the lifting we want to make on the part: a wing nut fixes it at the suitable point. Under this square is a copper rule notched in the workbench, and bearing a division on which this point can be found easily and without fumbling. By pushing the piece of wood along this square, and so that it does not deviate from it, one cannot fail to saw straight, observing the rule prescribed above not to force the cut. .

  The same R blade is also used for miter sawing; but then the sawing board is placed outside the blade on a part which is fixed for this purpose to this place of the workbench. This part, fig. 2, is composed of a wooden parallelepiped A-, on the underside of which is a dovetail groove, in which a wooden rule B slides: it is by means of two dowels made of copper, set below this ruler, that the workpiece fits to the workbench. On the upper face of the parallelepiped is a movable quadrant C, used to determine the opening of the angle of the miter that we want to make. A portion of a copper circle D, on which the quarter-circle C moves, bears the division of the circle into 3 ° degrees, by means of which all the angles can be easily found.

  When the quarter-circle is brought to the determined degree, the workpiece to be sawed is placed along its inner cheek, and the miter is removed without experiencing more difficulty than when sawing straight.

  Fig. 3 is the development of one of the saw arms. A, A, are two small pulleys which serve to reduce the friction of the arms against the rod, and which can be seen more clearly in fig. 4.

  We will not dwell more on the many advantages of this saw,with which you are always sure to follow exactly the line; which is not as easy as people who have not practiced it might believe: moreover, the use of the ordinary saw is quite tiring, whereas that of our chainsaw does not require more of effort than the Tour, and is therefore much better suited to people not used to heavy work.

  An Artist often finds himself in the case of drilling holes of a certain size in metals, for which the pressure of the stomach on the consciousness, and the force of the bow, are insufficient. All

  the simplest, and at the same time the best, machines imagined to make up for it, is that fig. 1, PL 9.

  This machine, which we will call the Drilling Machine, is mounted on a small A-slot workbench, similar to that of a Lathe. At the two ends of the groove, rise two mounts B, B, drilled on their height, with two rows of holes, and which are linked with the binoculars and the feet of the workbench by means of two bolts a, a, that go through it all.

  A crosspiece or box spring, C, is threaded on these two mounts by means of two mortises made at both ends. Holes corresponding to those of the mountings are drilled through these mortises, by means of which the bed base can be fixed at the desired height. A steel point, similar to that of a Tour, crosses the base at its center and is held there by a nut; It is under this point that the strong iron crankshaft D turns, the shape of which can be seen in the figure.

  Along the upright on the left rises an E iron rod, pierced through the top of a row of holes. This rod passes through the bed base, the groove of the workbench, and finally the pedal E, below which its lower end is held by an ankle. The pedal F is fixed between the two feet on the left, by means of two iron journals on which it pivots.

  When you want, using this machine, to drill a hole in a flat part, we start by covering the groove with a wooden plate G, on the middle of which we place the part so that the point to be drilled is sits perpendicular to the underside of the slant of the box spring, which is essential for straight drilling. To determine this position more easily, we use a ruler fig. 2, which fits between the two mounts by means of the two notches that can be seen in the figure, and which has in its middle a notch indicating the point where the lowered perpendicular of the tip of the bed base ends up on the surface of the board G, which must be perfectly upright. We therefore place the point to be drilled just below this notch, and we place on this point the point of a drill proportional to the hole that we want to drill, mounted in the head of the crankshaft that it must protrude a little. At the same time, we lower the base, the point of which enters the kind of bucket that can be seen at the upper part of the crankshaft, and we place in one of the holes of the mortise on the right a pin which also crosses the B-pillar. , putting the foot under the pedal at point H, the rod E is raised the most

high possible, and it is fixed to the bed base by passing a pin through the hole c which passes through the rod. All that remains is to put one drop (the oil in the crankshaft cup to facilitate movement, and another at the tip of the bit, if the part to be drilled is iron.

  After these arrangements, the crankshaft is set in motion and the drill is forced to penetrate into the material by pressing the foot more or less on the pedal, at point H, depending on the diameter of the hole. If the hole has not reached its depth when the pedal is lowered to the ground, it is necessary to remove the anchor from the mortise on the right, and that c, replace the base parallel to the workbench, raise the rod E as far as possible, and put back the pegs. If there was only a small thickness left to pierce like a line or two, there would be no need to disturb the ankle c, lowering the right side of the box spring sufficiently raising the pedal in this case.

  We have so far assumed that the part to be drilled is flat and of sufficient volume to be able to stand still under the force of the crankshaft. The parts of irregular shape and those which have only a small surface, are placed in a hand vice fig. 3, Pl. 4, which one holds with the left hand while one rotates the crankshaft of the right hand. They are raised a little by means of a wooden block which can also be used for the other parts, to preserve the table G, the surface of which would deteriorate quickly without this precaution.

  With regard to long pieces, they are gripped in a press fig. 5, so as to present the point to be drilled above. The press is placed on the workbench after removing the board G,and the excess part of the part is passed through the groove.

  We won't go into more detail on how to pick up irregularly shaped pieces; experience and usage teach more than we can tell.

  The drilling machine is still used for a few other purposes; thus it is used to turn the head and the shank of medium-sized screws, by means of flat cutters drilled in their center, fig. 3 and 4. The drill is replaced by a screwdriver which goes into the head of the screw, and thus forces it to descend into the hole of the bur which is fitted on a wooden block drilled in its center, and in the direction of the hole of the bur. The top of these strawberries is flat in those intended to make the stems. Those which are used to make the heads, carry in the center of their upper surface a square hole a, fig-3, or conical b, fig. 4, according to the shape of the heads A

and B. This process is widely used by gunsmiths who make a large number of screws of the same diameter, and in general it is very useful for people not used to turning metals.

  Finally, we can still make cores with the drilling machine using stud drills Fig. 6, but then we replace the crankshaft D, which would not give enough force, by a lever with two branches, similar to the screwdriver. to the left of a die, and which fits on the shank of the drill.

  The drilling machine, fig. 7, is not capable of producing as great an effort as the preceding one, but it advantageously compensates for the conscience, the use of which is not suitable for persons of delicate constitution, and with which it it is not always easy to drill straight.

  This machine is carried by a workbench A, on the front of which is a press B, intended to grip the part to be drilled by means of screws a, a.

  On the other side of the workbench, rises a cylindrical iron column C, fixed below by a nut, and seen larger, fig. 8, on which is threaded a copper barrel of two pieces D , seen larger, fig. 9. These two parts are joined by a bezel adjustment, which leaves in their interior the place of a ring whose threaded shank exceeds their exterior surface, and carries a wing nut. By tightening this nut the ring is drawn towards you, and the two pieces of barrel D, pressing strongly against column C, firmly fix the machine at the correct height and direction.

  At the two ends of the copper barrel, fig. 9, are made two staves to receive two bands of iron called molds E, E, fig. 7. Fig. 10 is a larger view of one of these months. We see in A the hole through which it is threaded on the barrel: a, a, are the holes intended to receive the iron rods c, c fig. 7, which are of the same height as the barrel, and thus retain the parallelism of the months. Fig. 11 represents one of these rods seen on a larger scale: b, b, are the nuts which fix it to the molds.

  At the end F of the molds, fig. 7 and 10, there is a hole intended to receive the crankshaft G, fig. 7. The shape of this crankshaft, which combines solidity with elegance and lightness, can be seen more clearly in fig. 12. A and B are two round and cylindrical rods passing through holes F, F, molds, in which they must turn very just, and which are lined with copper to soften the friction. The lower rod A is pierced with a square hole to receive the tenon of a box in

which fit the different drills. Movable copper C handle is melted onto the rod itself, and easily rotates on it

  Part II, fig. 7, is a spring which presses on this crankshaft, and replaces the strain of the stomach when one pierces the consciousness, or the pressure of the foot on the pedal in the machine, fig. 1.

  Fig. 13 shows it larger. A is a round hole that threads over the upper scope of the barrel, fig. 9, which for this purpose is longer than the lower scope. Two pointed screws a, a, are pricked in this scope, and leave to the spring the faculty to tilt on this point.

  The crankshaft is linked to the spring by means of the U collar, which embraces it. At the other end B, and on the flat of this spring, is a bulge carrying a nut, in which is mounted a pressure screw K, fig. 7 and fig. i 4, which abuts on the rod C, fig. 7, and serves to tension the spring more or less according to the force to be made by the drill.

  We see in L, fig.7 and fig.1 3, a wooden handle used to raise the spring and therefore the crankshaft.

  Fig. 15 is a copper vase crowning the column as seen in P, fig. 7. This vessel can be used to hold oil, which is continually needed, when drilling iron or steel.

  We are now going to give the means of drilling a hole with this machine. After placing theWith a suitable drill in the crankshaft, the double barrel nut D is loosened, in order to be able to raise the machine more or less depending on the height of the part, and bring the tip of the drill to the point to be drilled. We then place the part between the cheeks of the press, and before tightening it completely, we seek the most suitable position to be able to bring the drill well just above the point to be drilled, which is done by raising the crankshaft. using the Z / handle, and lowering the machine until the tip of the drill touches the surface of the workpiece at the determined point. O11 then tightens the spring more or less by means of the pressure screw K, and the crankshaft is set in motion, which, being contained by the two months, cannot fail to drill straight. If the crankshaft stroke is not sufficient to drill the hole to its depth, the ring nut should be loosened, the spring reassembled, and the machine lowered as many times as necessary.

  We thought we would please the Amateurs by adding here the drawing of a crankshaft, fig. 16, used to drill holes near a nip point, where the use of the ordinary crankshaft is impossible.

  This crankshaft is moved by means of a crank rotating in the direction of the rod, which sets in motion two wheels at angles which mesh with each other at 4 ^ degrees. The rod at the end of which moves the box carrying the drills, pivots at its other end on a copper slider fitted in the top of the handle.

  We will not go into greater detail on the construction of this crankshaft as the figure sufficiently clarifies.

** CHAPTER II Pieces which are performed on the Tour ci pointes and which present some difficulties.
*** SECTION ONE. Pelotonnoir.

  Everyone is familiar with these cotton balls of different shapes, whose artfully interwoven threads present to the eye diamonds, open circles, and whose figs. 4, 5, 6,7, 8 and 9, PI. 10, offer as many models as engraving can make these effects.

  We thought that our readers would be glad to find in our book the description of the machine with the help of which these balls are formed with the greatest ease.

  The mechanism of this ball, which has a lot to do with spinning wheels, consists in that the spindle on which the ball is formed has the ability to tilt more or less in front of the fin which presents the thread to it, and that this one receives a much more accelerated movement than that which is printed with the ball.

  Fig. 1 shows the elevation of the pelotonnoir seen from the front. Fig.2 shows it seen from the end, from the side of the ball; finally fig.3 is the geometric plan of this part.

  The whole instrument rests on a small table A, carried by four legs B, of which only two can be seen in figs. 1 and 2. These legs can be given the shape that we see in the figure, or any other .

  At one end of the table stand two C, J! G mounts. 1 and 3, between which is placed the big wheel D, fig. 1, 2 and 3, which turns with its shaft e, like the wheel of a spinning wheel. This shaft, set in motion with the aid of a crank E, fig. 3, carries at its other end a conical pulley, and several places of rope of the same figure.

---
Page 41 CHAP. II. Sect. I. Pelotonnoir.

  We will not stop at describing the construction of this wheel, and how to mount it on its shaft, as well as the adjustment of the feet and the mounts. For all these objects, we refer to Chapter III, Part 1, T.I, where they are dealt with in the greatest detail.

  At the opposite end of the table stand four montans, three of which F, F 1, F, are similar to those of the Ferris wheel. The fourth, G, fig. 3, is square in all its height, and has a groove in which slides the shaft of a pulley a, fig. 1, which serves to tighten the rope of the big wheel when it is released. by the effect of temperature change.

  Two sleepers L, L, join these montans by their top by means of a mortise assembly, and carry a small wooden carriage, N, fig. 3, which flows between these two sleepers, and in the middle of which is placed on two small copper flakes, the tree n which carries the fin o. This shaft is drilled lengthwise to receive the thread and transmit it to the fin which presents it to the ball. On the middle of the shaft n, is a pulley with several grooves, which receives the endless rope from the large wheel, and communicates to the fin a more or less accelerated movement, according to the ratio of the diameter of this pulley to that of the big wheel.

  Between the other two mounts, is placed a frame M, fig. 1, 2, and 3, which moves like a rocker at points O, O, fig. 1,2, 3, on two bolts which cross the mounts, and are retained on the outside by two wing nuts. It is on the lower cross member of this frame that the point of the spindle rotates, in a frame, at the other end of which the ball is formed. This spindle, on which a double barrel is threaded, is retained by a small copper collar fixed to the cross member Z 3, fig. 1 and 3, and carries a pulley whose rope corresponds to the other pulley d, fig. 3.

  It is by tilting this frame more or less that the ball takes on the necessary degree of inclination depending on the shape you want to give it. It is fixed at this point, by means of a portion of a toothed circle P, fig. 2 and a spring-loaded pawl which enters the teeth.

  Attached to the two rear riders is a small R frame, carrying an iron pin onto which the cotton rocket you want to grind is threaded. If the cotton were in a skein, this frame would become unnecessary, and it would have to be placed on a bundle reel, described in Chapter III, Section 5, T. I.

  We won't go into any detail of how to build and fit all of these parts; it offers nothing in particular, and that we

taught amply in our first volume; but we are going to Pl. io. try to make people understand the game of the machine and the means to use it.

  Considering the plane, fig. 3, we see that by setting the large wheel D in motion, the pulley which rotates the fin receives a movement that is all the more accelerated as its circumference is contained more times in that of the big Wheel. At the same time the small pulley d, attached to the shaft of the big wheel, sets in motion the pulley which turns the ball. The latter being of a larger diameter than the j * oulie d, walks more slowly, and it is by varying the ratio of these two movements, and the inclination of the frame M, that the shapes and forms can be varied. drawings ofare balls.

  To give an idea of ​​how to use this machine, we will first assume that the M-frame, and therefore the spindle on which the ball is to form, are placed horizontally. In this position, with the fin still carrying the thread in the same place, we would not make a ball, since all the turns of the thread would pass over each other. As you raise the spindle while lowering the frame, the turns of the thread will cross over each other as many times as the fin will turn around the ball during the revolution of the ball. The higher the spindle, the more the crossing turns will deviate from each other.

  When we have reached 4 ^ degrees of elevation and above, the threads crossing each other will give a more or less flattened shape at the ends of the ball; finally by approaching still more to the perpendicular, the towers, by crossing each other, will approach again the axis, and will form open squares, under which one can place colored paper, cut in the shape of a diamond, a star or otherwise, which brings out the whiteness of cotton. It is useful to observe that you have to thread these pieces of paper on the spindle before making the last turns that must cover them.

  To obtain the regular diamonds of fig.4, it is necessary that the diameters of the three pulleys are exactly contained in each other. To clear this up with an example, suppose the circumference of the Ferris wheel contains ten times that of the Fin pulley, the latter will make ten turns while the Ferris wheel will make one. If then the pulley d is contained three times in the one which carries the ball, this one will make a third of a turn while the first will make one; but the movement of that

Pl.10.

this being the same as that of the big wheel, the fin will turn thirty times while the ball completes its revolution, and consequently the thread will cross thirty times on the circumference of the ball, returning each time to apply exactly on the same points, and leaving between each turn equal intervals, which increase as the ball grows, and which form pyramidal holes, all tending to the center.

  When you have studied the game of the peloton, and have used it several times, it will be easy to find ways to vary the shapes and designs of the balls; taste and intelligence will teach more than we could add here.

*** SECTION II Flutes and Flageolet.

  The transverse flute fig. 1, consists of four main parts. The first A, where the mouthpiece is, is called the flute head. The second B, is the middle body, and has five holes, three of which give the natural notes G, A, B, and the other two, B flat and G sharp. These last two are covered with a key.

  The third piece C, called the avant-dough, has four holes, namely D, E, F, natural, and the key aefa sharp. Finally the last D, which is called dough, carries the key of E flat, or D sharp.

  The first of these pieces is composed of two pieces A, a, joined by a hollow cylinder, silver or copper, named Pump, E, the use of which is to be able to give at will more or less elongation to the instrument, and consequently raise or lower the tone as needed.

  The same piece has at its end a stopper or spherical cap F, which ends the flute. Between the cap and the mouth, a cork stopper is placed, the position of which we will determine.

  The wood most commonly used for making flutes is Spanish boxwood, which should be preferred to French boxwood. Woods from the islands are also used, such as ebony and pomegranate which gives the purest and clearest sound. We choose quarter wood, split with a coulter, and not with a saw, because the coulter follows exactly the grain of the wood, instead of the saw taking another direction. This is why we should not

---
Page 44 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.11.

use rolled or satin wood which is more pleasing to the eye, but which does not split straight.

  Choose four pieces of equal density, and as many of the same color as possible, and rough out the outside of each piece on a spiked lathe, leaving more diameter and length than it should be when finished. Then we will pierce it with the telescope with a cylindrical hole, much smaller than that determined by the figure, using a wooden telescope.

  Although the wood which one uses must have been chosen very sound and very dry, one will do well, after these preliminary operations, to expose it in a place sheltered from the sun and from the humidity, to leave it to have its effect.

  All the parts being thus drilled and roughed and perfectly dry, their hole will be made with tools appropriate to each, which are clamped perpendicularly in a vice and over which each body is passed, one after the other, while doing so. turn gently with your hands and almost without pressing. These tools called drills, by luthiers, are nothing more than a kind of ladle which must be much longer than the body for which they are intended, so that they can be used more conveniently. As for their shape, we see it in fig. 3, which represents a large ladle with which we finish the flute, as we will say shortly. The first is taken from A to B, the second from C to D, the third from E to F y and the fourth from G to H with an extension equal to approximately half the distance CB: without this extension added to each of these ladles, it could not enter the room for which it is intended, the hole of which is still cylindrical, and consequently narrower than necessary. These ladles will be given a little less diameter than the corresponding part of the large ladle, which must terminate the inside of the instrument. These tools must be very sharp. If as a result of their sharpening the diameter was reduced, they could still be used; as they have more length than is necessary, from the widest end as well as from the other side, it will suffice to insert the tool a little more forward, and until one is arrived at the proper point.

  We will then take care of making the staves, and the tenons, which bring together your four bodies of the instrument. The head of the flute A, which, as we have seen, is divided into two pieces, has three staves, two for the pump E, and one for the tçnon of the middle body B: this one has a tenon each. of its extremities, and consequently no reach.

---
Page 45 CHAP. II. Sect II. Flutes and Flageolet.

  The fore-dough C, on the contrary, has on the side of the middle body, a staff ,: and a tenon on the other side, which receives the staff of the dough.

  Each piece will be mounted separately on a conical mandrel, roughly similar to that in fig. 46, PI. 17 -, T. /, whose diameter is similar to that of the ladle. At the left end of this mandrel, we reserve a coil a little larger than the body of the flute to place the string.

  One cannot take too much care in making these mandrels, because if they do not turn exactly round, the external surfaces would not be concentric with those of the holes and the parts would be unequal in thickness, which would adversely affect the purity of the sound, and would prevent the exact assembly of the different bodies of the fread.

  It is quite ordinary to garnish the end of each staff with a circle, or ferrule, in silver, horn, or ivory. We must prefer those in silver, because the purpose for which we put them, is not so much to embellish the flute, as to give more solidity to the part which receives the tenon, and that we always tend to make remove by pushing in the tenon, trimmed with waxed threads, to prevent air from entering.

  We will glue these nets like those of the snuffboxes, after having adjusted them with the required precautions, and we will let them dry. Then put the pieces back into the Pointed Lathe, and give the outside the shape and size determined by the figure. Care should be taken, when making the tenons, to give them a size such that they easily enter the staff, so that they can be lined with a waxed thread, which makes their fit more firm; circular lines will be drawn on the tenon so that the wire does not slip.

  Then we will drill the holes as follows. We will start with those which must remain uncovered, and to determine their position with exactitude, we will draw on each part a line parallel to the axis, and we will mark on this same line the point of center of each hole at the position determined by the figure. As for the holes which must be covered by the keys, they will also be placed at the points indicated by the figure. The position of these latter holes, in relation to the circumference of the flute, is not essential. You can bring them closer or further away from the line on which the others are traced, depending on the length of the tail of the keys that you must have obtained in advance, because the end of this tail must always arrive at the point where it is seen in the figure for the convenience of fingering.

  As there are no written rules for placement and space-

However, we have chosen one of the best, and we have taken the greatest care in the execution of the engraving. These holes, as can be seen from the figure, are unequal; their diameter is also indicated with the greatest care in the figure.

  However, however exact our engraving may be, as the paper always elongates more or less on printing, and this elongation is unequal, according to the quality of the paper, we have thought it necessary to trace, below and above the fig. 2, two lines bearing the exact dimensions and the distance of each of these holes in lines and points.

  The lower line shows the exact length of each body.

  The top line gives the exact diameter of each hole and the distance from center to center.

  We see in the section, fig. 2, the internal diameter of the flute near the stopper, below the last key, and finally at the lower hole of the instrument.

  To take all these measurements, with the most rigorous accuracy, we imagined the compass fig. 4. This compass is formed of two branches, assembled by a small bolt riveted to point A- The two points d, e, are similar to those of Mciître-à-danser; and as they can be made to overlap one on the other, this compass can be used to measure the interior as the exterior of a part: but its main advantage is to be able to give with exactitude the smallest measurements, and this is what results from its construction.

  One of the branches carries at its upper end a portion of a divided circle B; and the other ends with a point or index C. We see by this construction that the branehes being united well below their midpoint, the opening B, C, is much larger than that of d, e, although still proportional. Therefore when the opening d, e, will be equal to a line, that B, C, will be equal to four, five or six, depending on the dimensions and the assembly of the branches of the compass.

  If therefore we mark, on the portion of circle B, the point of division corresponding to a line of opening of the branches d, e-, this division can easily be subdivided into four, six, and even twelve parts, and will consequently give the means of measuring the smallest spaces with the most rigorous accuracy.

  When we have determined the place of the centers of all the trpus, we

Pl.11.

draw on each, with a spring compass, a circle with the indicated diameter, and we will open them all to the same diameter with a pointed bit, smaller than the smallest of the holes; then we will grow them one after the other to their diameter, by means of a conical milling cutter, fig. 5, without reaching the line. For more precaution, we use a conical gauge, fig. G, on which are marked circular lines with the exact diameter of each of the holes that are widened, so that the gauge can enter it up to the line which must however remainer outside. When the flute is completely finished, we will finish with a penknife to put each hole to its exact diameter, which can only be done by trying the flute and removing the material with a penknife until the sound is good. pure and clean.

  If, at the beginning, we had removed too much wood, it would not be possible to return to it, and that is why we have advised to always leave the draft outside.

  The holes must be flared in the interior, which is done by means of a shank cutter described T. /, pag. 86, and shown in fig. 12, PL n, of the same volume.

  We must now put the pump in place, and unite all the bodies by lining the tenons with waxed thread, as we have said, so that the centers of the holes discovered are all on the same line, after which we give inside the precise shape it must have by passing the large bore through it, fig. 3.

  This bore must have exactly the shape of a truncated cone, cut perpendicular to its base, and the interior of which is hollowed out by a portion of a circle that is not concentric on the exterior, as can be seen by the section in fig. 7.

  The cutting edge of the bore must have two straight lines, and cut perfectly. The back should be very polished so as not to crumple the wood, for the goodness of the instrument depends mainly on the neatness of the hole, the walls of which should not present the slightest obstacle to the passage of air.

  This bore is fixed vertically in a vise by the pin L, and the flute is threaded from the side of the mouth; then grasping it with both hands, it is rotated slowly and almost without pressure, until you reach line A, which indicates the exact diameter of the upper hole. As the tool will lose its diameter due to the effect of. sharpening, this line will approximate the tenon. It's for

---
Page 48 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.11.

this we must give this bore more length than it seems necessary.

  Sharpening this tool requires great care; you should never touch the outside, but run a flat sharpener inside, moving it obliquely along the entire length of the cutting edge.

  If we made a flute out of island wood, such as ebony, pomegranate, or the like, it might be that the hand was not strong enough to turn it on the bore. To make up for this, a wooden collar will be fitted to the head of the flute, y? G. 8, composed of two semicircles A, B, one of which ends with two levers similar to the arms of a die. The other collar is joined to the first using bolts 6 T, D, the threaded end of which receives a wing nut E. The diameter of these two joined semi-circles must be a little larger than that of the outer part of the flute which they embrace. They will be lined on the inside with a piece of white skin that will protect the surface of the flute from the effects of pressure, and prevent the collars from slipping while turning.

  It is now necessary to place the four keys and the stopper which is at the end of the head of the flute. This last piece presents no difficulty; it is a kind of hemisphere followed by a tenon whose F-shape can be seen in figs. 1 and 2; we must make it from the material with which the flute is filled, and we can practice all kinds of embellishments at will. As for the keys, the way of making them is entirely foreign to our art. The luthiers themselves have them performed by artists who only engage in this kind of work, so we assume that the Amateur who wants to make a flute will have obtained the keys in copper, silver or gold. We will first present each key on its hole, and, with a very fine scribe, we will mark on the surface of the flute the place that the plate h, fig. 1 must occupy, then we will lift a small thickness of wood equal to that of the plate, which will be fixed to it by means of two very short screws, so that they do not reach the interior surface of the instrument. When the keys are all in place, we will garnish the underside of each with a small piece of buffalo of medium thickness, and cut according to the shape of the key. We know that in order to thin the skin, we must always remove the material from the flesh side of the animal. We will place each skin fly on the hole for which it is intended, on the flesh side, we will lightly coat the other side with a little thick glue, after which we will press the thumb on the key for a few moments.

  We will then place the cork stopper G at the top of the head of the flute,

Pl.11.

and in the place shown in the figure. For this, we will use the repeller fig. 9, which is nothing more than a boxwood cylinder intended to put this stopper in place, and to push it out when we want to clean the inside of the flute.

  In this state the flute is roughly terminée, and must already give fairly accurate sounds, but a little muffled. To make the instrument more sonorous, the dough Z) must be flared from the edge of the hole, which is done with a bore whose small and large diameter are shown in fig. 2. Then we will try all the notes one after the other, and if there is one that is not in the right tone, we will widen the orifice of the hole which gives it with a penknife, as we do. we said while teaching to drill the holes.

  In order not to interrupt the course of our operations, we assumed that the Amateur had provided himself with a ready-made pump; but as this play does not present great difficulties, we believe it is our duty to teach here how to do it.

  This pump is nothing more than a silver or copper tube, the interior of which exactly follows the shape of the interior of the flute; this is why it must be put in its place before passing the last piercing.

  To make this tube, we cut a parallelogram of metal, of the length determined, in fig. 2, at E. The width must be such that by approaching the two edges, we obtain a cylinder with a smaller diameter d a line than that of the pump, when it is finished.

  These two edges will be welded with silver solder, by the procedures indicated on page 201 T. T. We will scrape, and we will clean the inside well with pumice. In this state, we will put it on a conical steel triboulet, fig. 10, of the exact diameter of the bore, at point C: the portion of this triboulet from a to b has exactly the shape that the interior of the pump; you will strike very lightly over the entire surface of the tube, until it has descended to point a. The interior then presents a perfectly even hole equal to that of the flute. We mount the piece in the lathe in the air, on a hardwood cylinder, and we put it to the length determined by the figure, making the interior perfectly cylindrical.

  There are flutes where the pump is made up of two copper or silver barrels, one of which flows over the other, and fits into the thickness of the body of the flute. This adjustment may be more pleasing to the eye, but it does

not make the instrument better; and as it is more difficult than the one we have described, we thought we should stick to this one.

  Fig. 12 shows a flute of the old model. This one does not have a pump like the previous one, but it is replaced by the two spare bodies, fig. i 3 and i 4, which serve to shorten the flute more or less, putting them in the place of the middle body. The one that is mounted on the face gives as much stretch as possible. Moreover, this flute is performed absolutely by the same procedures as the previous one; it is only necessary to pass the large bore through it three different times to adjust the replacement bodies with the other parts.

  Note that this flute has only one key for D; the sharps and flats, which in the previous one are performed using the clefs, are done in this one by crossing the fingers.

  The so-called dream flute octave, fig. 15, is nothing other than flute n ° 1, reduced to half. This has only one key, like the flute in fig.12; but it has a pump like the one in fig. 1.

  The flageolet, fig. 16, is made up of two parts; the head A which carries the beak B, and the light with the windbreaker C; and the body D which has six holes, four 1s above for the notes D, F, G, A, and two below for the E and the B. The dotted circles indicate the place of the latter two.

  These two pieces first hollow and sketch separately in the same way as those that make up the body of the flute; after which they are brought together to finish them outside and inside, using for this last operation the bore, fig. 17, which differs from that in fig. 8 only in its dimensions.

  The holes are drilled at the points indicated by the divided line below the figure. Their precise diameter is indicated on the same line, and we see that all are equal, except for the one in the middle which gives the soil.

  In this state the lower part, called the flageolet body, is complete, and all that remains is to form the beak and lumen at the end of the head; which is done in the following way.

  A cylindrical, or rather very slightly conical, wooden stopper of a distinct color will be turned with that of the body of the instrument, and of the length marked in fig. 16, from a to b. We will put it in the head of fliite-, and we will adjust it so that it does not leave any passage to the air. We will then remove it, and in its place we will make a groove in the interior of the fiageolet. This groove, whose shape we want

Page 51 CHAP. II. Sect. II. Flutes and Flageolet.
Pl.11.

in D, fig. 18, does not exceed the tangent of the inner circle, and extends a little lower than point b,fig. 16, which indicates the end of the plug. We make, over the entire length of the stopper, a lift of the same width as this groove; but before putting it back in its place, to fix it there, it is necessary to take care of making the light with the cock) e-vent C; this is done by first drilling two very thin drill holes on the outside of the instrument at point b, i.e. a little above the end of the groove. We will then form at this point, and transversely, an oblong opening, and perpendicular to the outer surface, and the width of which is indicated in the figure. For this operation, use a well sharpened stall, the edge of which is precisely the width of the opening you want to make.

  It is with the same tool that we form the bevel which follows this opening, and which is called Windbreaker. This bevel ends in the middle of the thickness of the channel, formed by. the groove and the lifting of the plug, and thus shares the air flow transmitted through this channel, hence the name windbreak.

  In all this operation, the stall must be handled with great care, and very little wood at a time, for fear of removing splinters and damaging the angle formed by the bevel and the end of the groove; because the sharpness of this angle greatly influences the purity of the instrument's sound.

  The stopper will then be glued in its place, making the lift made along its length match the groove made in the interior, to form the channel through which the air is introduced into the body of the instrument after having been shared by the angle of the windbreak.

  When everything is very dry, we will hollow out the underside of the mouthpiece, removing a portion of the circumference of the instrument and a very large part of the stopper; which is done using files and rasps. We will follow, as much as possible, the contours determined by the figure. We say as much as possible, because this curvature is not strictly the only one on which we must guide ourselves: the main thing is that we can easily grasp the tip of the beak between the lips.

  Flageolets are quite often made of ebony, grenadilla or other precious wood, and then it is customary to garnish the mouthpiece and the end with ivory, as well as the staves which join the two parts of the instrument. To do this, after having separately blanked the outside of each part, we glue in the places indicated ivory ferrules, of thickness and length

sufficient, and we turn them by decorating them with moldings at will by finishing the flageolet.

  The underside of the Lee is hollowed out in the same way and with the same files and rasps as if it was not coated in ivory.

*** SECTION III. Turn oval, with sides and eccentrically between two points y and with several centers.
Pl.12

  The way of turning an oval between two points does not give an oval proper, since we will see that this oval is only the meeting of two portions of a circle, which necessarily produces an angle at each point of intersection, fig. 29, Pl. 12: but this method is no less ingenious, and can suffice in an infinity of small works, such as a knife handle, a case, etc.

  We will first turn a cylindrical part. Cut the ends with a chisel so that they have a straight surface. At the same distance from the edges, we will draw on both ends a circle n, c, d, either with a barley grain or otherwise, so that both have the same diameter. We will divide these circles into four equal parts, by tracing on each of them two diameters bd and oc, which intersect at right angles; and in order for these divisions to correspond exactly on both ends, we will extend one of the diameters to the outer circumference of that point. We will draw a line along the length of the cylinder, which divides it into two equal parts over its thickness, that is to say which is well in the axis of the cylinder: to achieve this, we will place the part on a surface well straight, such as a mirror, marble, etc. Approach it with a well-drawn ruler, the width of which is exactly the same throughout its length; then the line will be drawn on the cylinder using a point or pencil directed along the ruler. In this operation, we can replace with advantage the rule by the standing gauge, fig.6, PL 3, T. II. This last instrument must be preferred, because the point, fixed invariably to the rod of the gauge, traces the line with much more regularity than that which is driven by hand along the rule. At the point of intersection a, corresponding to each end, we will place a point of the Tour, by means of which the part

---
Page 53 Sect. III. Turn oval, sloped, etc.
Pl.12.

will turn with a very eccentric movement, but regular as regards the piece. In this circumstance, the march must be led with some caution, because of the jolts caused by the eccentricity. You can even put in the recessed part, that is to say, which, while turning, does not protrude enough from the ribs, so that at this place where the string is placed, the part turns round or roughly. We will start with the gouge, at first in small strokes, not along the entire length of the room, but by reserving a part at each end without touching it for the use that we will bring back. We will reach until we are close to the line drawn on the cylinder. Then with a chisel we will dress the new surface well: and as we always experience jumps, when the chisel passes over the part where it does not take, it is necessary to have a great use of this tool to be able to turn well even. We can see that the line to which the new surface ends is one of the points of intersection of the curve that we have described with the chisel.

  We will then put the piece on the Lathe in the center opposite to the previous one; and we can thus see why we reserved the original roundness of the two ends: because, without this, one of the two centers would already be carried away. We will shoot the same on these new centers, and until we reach the same line. If you think about it, you will feel that the new shape is the one we announced above, and that it is not an oval proper, since there are two fairly sharp curvilinear angles at opposite points. They can be softened, either with horsetail, or with polishing paper, or in any other way.

  If we understand this operation correctly, we can, with some attention, correct the defect in the shape it produces, and get closer to the oval: here are the ways.

  Remember that we divided the circumference of the cylinder into four equal parts, and that we took the end of the wood to remove the two opposite parts, equally distant from the centers; which gave two segments of a circle. We will divide this into eight equal parts, and we will remove from the tool, some wood until we leave only two eighths, which will however still present a mixed curve, which jar, that is to say -to say, which the two parties do not agree with each other; but the angles will be softened with a rasp, a squeegee, or simply with horsetail or polishing paper. Moreover, we have not claimed to give here a process capable of producing a regular ellipse, our intention has been to indicate what can be singularly done on the Pointes Tour.

  Now let's apply these principles.

---
Page 54 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.12.

  The curve e, g, f, obtained by the operation just described, can be suitable for a column, a baluster, etc.

  We must remember that we had to resLeave enough wood at each end of the room to place the points at the different centers, which assumes that the primitive centers have also been reserved. When the room is finished with the greatest cleanliness, it will be put back on its center; then, with a gouge, one will remove almost all the wood which is held at the top of the vase, if it is one, fig. 10, PL 2, by reducing this part to a suitable size to form an acorn, a ball, a pine cone, or any other ornament; but to more pleasantly deceive those who do not know how these kinds of lathe pieces are made, care will be taken that this center remains marked on the end, to induce people to believe that the piece has been turned entirely on this center; and to be more successful, we will reserve on this side, starting to turn the piece, only about what is needed for the length of the ornament intended for the top of the vase, and the coil will have always been on the other end. Nothing is so unique as a flat piece, which, with a visible center, still has a round part. We will remove the coil at the other end, cutting the wood just below the last molding at the bottom of the room.

  If we wanted this piece to have less thickness, relative to its width, it would have to be taken in a piece of a very large diameter, so that the centers of each face would be very far from that of the cylinder; which would give arcs belonging to a larger circle, and which stray less from the chord than those of a smaller circle. You can convince yourself of this by drawing these circles on a piece of paper.

  One can also turn, between two points, columns, balusters, and other parts with three or four faces. See fig. 30, that with four sides, and its section below: that with three, fig. 3 i, the section below, and that with two, fig. 32, the section below. All you have to do is divide the circles that are drawn at each end into six or eight equal parts. We say six or eight, although we only offer three or four sides; because it is always necessary to draw, from each of the points along the length, lines which serve to guide to roughen, and to mark the line which will result from the meeting of the two faces, in the same way as the line e, f, fig. 29, guided for the flat column. But you have to cut the wood very carefully; because the shards would form abrasions at the angles, the merit of which is to be very sharp: also it is especially in this case that we must not make the revolution

entire piece being turned, and have a good grasp of the tools, which must cut very fine.

  The piece, fig. 33, which by its form is very singular, is usually performed on the eccentric of which we will speak elsewhere; and even she got used to it much more regularly and with greater ease. However, to satisfy our readers, we will provide the means to perform on the Tour à pointes.

  We will begin by turning a cylinder of some hard and firm wood, that is to say, folding point, such as boxwood, corm or holly a little old, so that it is quite dry, because this wood is a very long time to dry. This cylinder will be made eighteen to twenty lines in diameter and five to six inches long. The two ends will be drawn up perfectly, keeping the centers there. First, draw along its length a line parallel to the axis, which runs from end to end. We will then draw, on each end of the cylinder, from the ends of this line, another line which passes exactly through the center, and which divides the circle into two perfectly equal parts. Then, at equal distances from the centers, a circle will be drawn on each end, the diameters of which are perfectly equal. This inner circle should be away from the edge of the cylinder by a distance equal to half the diameter that we want to give to the ladies we are going to talk about. We must recognize, in this operation, the one we have just described, by teaching ourselves to turn oval, between two points, and which we repeat here for the greater understanding of the operation. We will divide the inner circles into six equal parts, and each dividing point will be a center point.

  We will practice, at one end of the part, a coil, from which the rope cannot come out while turning: then having put the part between two points, at two of the eccentric points which correspond to each other, we will bring a part to the circle. of wood the thickness of a playing queen, digging with a donkey's lip, in the protruding part, until the surface of the re-entrant part has been reached. But for fear of tearing the wood, on the right and on the left, we will cut, very carefully, on each side with a very sharp barley grain. By this means no scratches will be made, and by going slowly, the wood will be cut as neat as with a chisel. During this operation it is necessarytake care to move the donkey's lip to the right and to the left, about a quarter of a line, so that the hollow is always a little wider than the tool, to prevent it from catching and spoils side surfaces.

  The tool we recommend for use here only scrapes the

Page 56 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.12.

wood, which therefore can never come out smooth and clean from under the tool, as if using a regular chisel. To overcome this drawback, one of the following two methods can be used. Or we will present the cutting edge of the tool, obliquely, along the length of the wood, so that the bevel below is almost tangent with the surface of the wood; but this obliqueness can only be obtained by removing the skillful hand or the left hand, which assumes that the hollow is large enough to allow it, and that the sides of the protruding part will not be touched. The other means, which we have used advantageously in an infinity of circumstances, consists in making, if one has the convenience, a chisel which has, on an ordinary length, six to eight lines in width, and which be reduced, at the end, to two lines or about an inch to fifteen lines long: see fig. 34 - This chisel being sharpened very obliquely, and being led with great care, produces the best effect in all cases where we want to cut the wood cleanly on the very narrow parts; but the piece must turn very slowly, and above all take wood only from the middle of the width of the chisel, going towards the lower angle.

  We replace the chisel, fig. 34, by turning over the edge of the beak with a burnisher, after having sharpened it, as we said in treating of sharpening in the first volume.

  When this first part is finished, and we have formed a kind of queen to play, we will put the part at the two following eccentric points, and we will operate in the same way, taking its measurements exactly enough so that the hollow that we are going to form is the same width as the previous one. This operation only presents difficulty for cutting the wood very clean, leaving no scratches, and that all the washers or checkers adjacent to each other are of the same thickness and the same diameter. We will move to the third center point, then to the fourth, and successively to each other, to the seventh, eighth, ninth, etc., although there are only six marked; for then the one with whom one began will become the seventh; the second will be the eighth, and so on, until you get to the other end of the cylinder.

  It is appropriate here to prevent a difficulty which is encountered in the operation; is that when we have passed the second or third lady, the wood being hollowed out in the center of the cylinder, if the points are a little tight, the part bends towards the middle, especially if it is a little long, and

  the tool only grazes. It is therefore necessary in this case to tighten moderately the points, and to start the wood with small blows. When the play is finished we put it back on its original centers, and we cut both ends to annihilate all those on whom the play was made, which gives the change to those who do not know how the operation is done. Then she looks like a series of ladies, who are placed one on top of the other off-center, turning, and in a very regular manner.

  To further increase the difficulties and the singularity of the piece, instead of all the ladies touching each other by a part of their surfaces, they can be detached from each other, joining them only by a cylinder of very small size. diameter or a small ball, which unites them to each other through the center. Here's how to do it.

  As we hollow out the wood between two ladies, and before moving on to the next one, we will just insert, without forcing, a wedge of wood between these two ladies. We will work these wedges with a rasp or customs, trying them from time to time, until they hold by simple friction in their place, and the pressure of the two points, however slight, will be sufficient for them. retain it.

  To surprise more pleasantly, one often pierces the cylinder in its center and in all its length, with a drill of two lines or approximately of size. When the ladies are detached, pass through this hole a small brooch the entire length of the room, which can be carried to six or seven inches with great care, and which is crowned with a vase or other ornament. Nothing is so unique as seeing each lady pierced through her thickness in an eccentric way.

  We will therefore begin by turning a cylinder of suitable size, to find the vessel there, which we will turn with care; then we will make a staff of two or three lines below the vasewide, and the diameter of the hole. You will make a similar small tenon at the other end. We will then use the wedge to be supported, shown in fig. 19, PL 18 of T. /, to reduce the rod to the smallest diameter possible, without it bending too much. We will make three, four, five or six lengths to the size of the hole, in order to be able then, with the rasp or the slipper, to put all the length to the desired size, and to make sure that it is perfectly straight and round. We will soon be teaching how to do the Air Tower pieces of a much smaller diameter.

  So that this brooch passes at the same time through the center of the room and in the circle of each lady, and so that the hole does not meet on the edge, or outside the diameter of some ladies, it is necessary to draw on the paper, first the circle of the cylinder, then all the circles with the diameter that we want to give to the ladies, so that the primitive center meets in the interior of the circles of all the ladies, and give each one on the Tour precisely the diameter that was determined for them on paper.

  We will give in one of the following chapters how to make this piece much more easily on the Tour en air, using the eccentric machine; but in order to follow the plan which we have drawn up for ourselves, we have thought it necessary to give the manner of doing it beforehand to the Tour à pointes.

*** SECTION IV. Turn square pieces between two points, by means of cylinders.

  First, choose a fairly strong piece of good wood, such as an apple tree, aliz tree, or other hardwood, about four inches or so in size, and about a foot long. We will see later from this description, that the larger it is, the better we will succeed in all the parts we are going to talk about. After having prepared it properly with an ax, put it between two points, and we reduce one end to fifteen or eighteen lines in diameter, about three inches long; which will form in this place a coil, as seen, fig. 5. in a, to put the rope of the Tour. The end of the cylinder will be drawn up perfectly on the side of the coil. We will use the varlope, a small plank of some good wood, like walnut or other. A hole of sufficient size will be drilled in the center and on the Lathe so that the coil just enters it. But before fixing it in place, there is an operation to be done on the cylinder.

  We will draw near each of these ends, with a very sharp barley grain, and on the Tour, a light line. The circumference of this circle will be divided into six or eight perfectly equal parts. To do this, you can mount the part on the Tower in the air, and use the platform to be divided. Then returning the part to the Pointed Lathe, we will approach the bar or the support wedge directly against it, if the latter is used, and we will make sure that it is horizontal; for this we will take as a guide the two points of the dolls.

---
Page 59 CHAP II Sect IV Turning Square Pieces
Pl.12.

  With a pencil or a scribe, you will draw lines parallel to the axis, starting from each point of division. We will check with a compass if at the other end the division is correct.

  It is now a question of practicing along the length of the cylinder, suitable grooves to house the parts that you want to turn. They will be given a perfectly equal width and depth, and this operation is quite difficult.

  Fig. 6 shows the division of one end of the cylinder into eight equal parts, and the depth of the grooves; or to put it better, it represents the cylinder seen from one end, and the void left by the eight grooves. You can do more or less, depending on the number of pieces you want to make, but as these grooves must be equal in width throughout their depth, if too many are made, the wood that remains between they, diminishing in thickness, would not have sufficient solidity. Fig. 5 shows the cylinder seen along its length.

  We will trace with the greatest accuracy, on each end, these smooth canes, and we will give inside each line, a saw cut approximately to the depth of the groove. We will first hollow out the wood contained between the two saw cuts, with chisels of suitable width. If the cylinder had a certain length, we would use angled scissors like the tool fig. 45, PI. 9, of the first volume. After having readjusted these grooves in their entire length, with a guillaume, we will finish drawing them in all directions, using the Jew's harp, fig. 55, PL 9, T. I.

  We will drive the iron in little by little, until touching the bottom of the groove, when the board is on both sides, we are sure to have given an equal depth from end to end, to the groove.

  To do this, hold the jaw harp with both hands by its ends, and the edge of the blade will be perpendicular to its length. The cylinder must be fixed in an invariable manner on a workbench or in a vice, taking care not to spoil, by the pressure of a valet or any other instrument, the grooves already made. The iron should cut very sharp, the bevel a little short and well drawn, in relation to the board which contains it. This tool will be run successively over the entire bottom of the groove, which in a short time will be erected, and equal everywhere in depth. Take care not to disturb the iron of the jaw harp, which should be used to put the other grooves at the same depth as the first.

---
Page 60 TURNER'S MANUAL
Pl.12.

  To dress the two sides of the groove, you can use a side guillaume. This guillaume looks quite like all the others, except that the iron is perpendicular to the shaft, or wood of the tool, that it cuts only from the side, and that the bevel is inclined at the cheek of the tool. 'tool. The tip of the iron does not cut, and should be a little at an angle, like a lathe tool, so that it does not eat or touch the bottom of the groove. This tool is difficult to do well, to put in kegs, and to operate; but also it perfectly erects the interior walls.

  We dwell on all these details, because the accuracy and regularity of these grooves being essential for the perfection of the work, we can not pay too much attention. A perfect wooden rod is neededit is squared to their measure, just goes all over the place in each groove, and fills them perfectly.

  When we have made sure of their regularity, we will put the small board, which we have spoken about on the coil a, which we have reserved for the cylinder for the rope. Secure it with pin nails and better still with somewhat thin wood screws, but fifteen to eighteen lines long. Then we will put the part back on the Lathe, and we will turn this board, which we must have first put roughly round, with a saw.

  In this state the cylinder is finished, and if the centers are a little deep, one should not fear that it ceases to be round in the operations which follow.

  To make the six or eight pieces that must be placed in the grooves, take them, as much as possible, in the same piece, which will be squared on all four sides, giving it a little larger than the parts should be, to fill the grooves of the cylinder; they will then be cut to the determined length; and to make them perfectly equal to each other, we will use an instrument called Notch, which we will describe and use.

  Take a piece of some good wood, three inches square, or even a little more, and eighteen inches long or so. We will correct it exactly, at least on two neighboring faces. We will draw with a gauge, on the top face, two lines with a spacing a little larger than the dimension of the grooves. Then with another gauge which will be made to flow on the same surface, one will draw on the two ends, which must be perfectly drawn up, a line to indicate the depth of the groove. We will hollow out all the wood between these lines, with just as much care as we took in making the grooves of the cylinder, and with the same jaw harp.

Page 61 CHAP. II SECT. IV. Rotate Square Pieces
Pl.12.

  One end of the groove will be plugged with a fairly tight square plug; stop it with a few pin nails, the head of which will be drowned with a punch; Similarly, with a few pin nails, attach a small wooden rod, following the length of the groove on 1 notch, four or five lines from the edges to the right. This rod is used to direct always in the same direction the plane which one is going to use, and of which by this means the iron always cuts on the same point.

  So when we have put in the groove one of the eight pieces of wood, the surface best erected below, we will see it slightly exceed the upper surface of the notch. A standing planer blade will be sharpened on the oil stone, in order to avoid splinters, and the better to dress. Very little iron will be put in this plane, and this iron must be perfectly in cask, so that it does not eat more on one side than on the other. Plan until the iron stops biting; and then we are assured of a regular thickness, and that the two surfaces are indeed parallel. We will turn the piece over on another face, and we will plan in the same way, which will give a very exact parallelepiped, which, if we have taken its dimensions well and operated well, should fit into the grooves of the cylinder, very just. without forcing. We will do the same for the other seven, and we will put them in place.

  As these pieces are difficult to cut well, it is appropriate to make them from some hard and bonding wood, at the same time as beautiful. The one that has worked best for us is the dry, knotless holly; the cormier is also doing well; but these pieces are nicer being white.

  It is very important that the ends which rest against the circle which exceeds the diameter of the cylinder are perfectly erected; we will feel the need for it in a moment.

  It is not enough that all these parts fit in their grooves. The operation which will follow tends to disturb them; thus they must be firmly secured in their place, by means of a copper circle, fig. 7, composed of two semicircles joined by a hinge, and having at their ends two copper cores, one of which lets through one square head screw, having a collar, and the other is tapped. Using a pendulum key, this circle will be tightened, which will hold the eight pieces on the cylinder.

  In this state we will put the cylinder between two points, and we will make such a profile as we want; like vase, column, baluster or others, like that of fig. 8, which represents a cylinder in which are notches or triangular grooves, of which we will speak in a moment.

---
Page 62 TURNER'S MANUAL
Pl.12.

  It will be observed that the baluster formed on the cylinder furnished with its eight pieces, must not have the same proportions as the others, and that the moldings must have less protrusion; otherwise the parts placed in the splines would be cut by the tool.

  Here is the rule to follow to avoid this inconvenience. A baluster will be drawn which can be inscribed in one of the square or trian pieces.gulars, and the moldings will be transported to the baluster formed by the union of the eight pieces on the cylinder.

  Before picking up the tool, we will make sure that all the parts also rest against the plate that we have adapted to the cylinder; and that is the only use for which it is intended. If we want to make columns, we will only take one lengthwise; but if we decide on balusters or vases, we can find two. However, it is necessary in all cases, that the circles which connect all the parts, are outside the drawing which one wants to carry out.

  We will begin by roughing with a gouge, until we reach on all the points the pieces that have been added, and whose reunion presents to the eye the shape of an octagon or a hexagon that we have to start by putting things in the round. And we won't worry if, to achieve this, we have to cut into the cylinder a bit. Circular lines will then be marked with the angle of the chisel to determine the moldings. Then with a sharp gouge a little long, we will rough out the parts that need to be hollowed out in small strokes. The work will be brought close to the forms it should have; we will finish with a chisel that cuts perfectly. In the hollow and narrow parts, one will use the side of a gouge, which, being skilfully directed, will produce the effect of a chisel cutting at an angle. When we have given the suitable shapes, we will polish with very fine paper, then we will put, if we want, a little wax, which we extend with a piece of white wood, terminated by two bevels; and we will rub with a piece of serge, to remove the wax and give the wood shine. This is when the first operation is completed.

  We will remove the cylinder from above the Lathe, we will loosen the circles, and removing the parts one after the other from their grooves, we will put them back in by placing the finished face against that of the sides of the groove which is in front against the Turner, lac orde being placed to its left. The wood, coming onto the tool, is cut sharper; instead of the other side there would be burrs. On the fourth side, it is necessary to redouble precautions to avoid these burrs, to use the gouge and the slanted chisel, in order to cut the wood more clean, while going with very small blows.

Page 63 CHAP II. SECT. IV Turning Square Pieces
Pl.12

  Care must be taken when turning the last three faces to reach the cylinder with the tool. The slightest alteration would affect the profiles. Soon the four faces would no longer resemble each other; and the threads, the gorges, the squares, the listellos would cease to match. Care should be taken in obtaining this latter result, and here is the only way to achieve it. When the circles have been put back in place, strike the right end of each rod with a small hammer until it rests exactly against the board; This is why we have recommended that the ends of the rods be properly erected at right angles, so that these ends, resting at all points on the table top, the moldings can always match exactly. Thus will be completed by a single operation, eight pieces, which, when they are isolated, do not appear to be able to be done on the Tour.

  We cannot repeat it enough, this operation requires a lot of patience, precision, lightness of hand, both for the gouge and the chisel, and customary to handle them, both on the right and on the left. As soon as one of the four faces is made, and it is applied against one of the sides of the groove, it is obvious that there is a void at the location of the moldings, since a bypassed part cannot s 'apply on a straight part. Nothing supports the wood in these places, and if we do not take the greatest care, the angles are torn without remedy by the effort of the tool, which, taking these eight pieces only jerkily, necessarily throws burrs or splinters apart. For example, when it comes to cutting the body of a baluster or any other re-entrant curve, use a chisel as far as possible; there is no wood which resists this way of cutting it; but you have to be sure of your tool; if it escapes the slightest bit, everything is irretrievably spoiled. We see, fig-9, the effect of one of these completed balusters. It is the same with a column, a vase, etc. this is the shape the part had before it was worked, if it is a triangular part; and d is the one she acquired through work. We see that each face is part of a circle whose radius is the same as that of the cylinder; and it is easily understood that the greater the circumference of the cylinder compared to the width of the parts, the more the faces of the latter will approach the straight line.

Page 64 TURNER'S MANUAL.
*** SECTION V. Turning Triangular Pieces.

  After the details we just went into, we won't stop much at describing how to turn triangular or three-sided parts. We feel that it is enough for the top of the groove to form an angle of sixty degrees; these grooves present more difficulties than the first, both because of the regularity of the cut, and because the vertex of the angle must tend to the center of the cylinder, and the sides of the triangle must be equal, and equally inclined at the base which is the circumference of the cylinder.

  You will make a cylinder similar to the previous one, the size of which is determined by the width and the number of pieces you want to place in it, adding the distance that must exist between each groove; and as long as there is one or two lines between each, this will suffice, since the intervals are not starved towards the center as in the previous cylinder. We will start by drawing a line along the length of the cylinder, using one of the methods we have indicated. Then we will draw with a barley grain a circle towards each end, the circumference of which will be divided into as many parts as we want to make grooves in it. We will lead by each of the points of division of the parallels to the axis; one will then carry on each of these divisions an opening of compass equal to one of the faces of the groove, and one will lead new parallels by each of these new points.

  We will draw on each end of the cylinder a circle at the smallest possible distance from the outer circumference, and we will return on this circle all the points of division given by the end of the parallels.

  We will then take a compass opening, equal to the width of one of the faces; and from one of the points indicating the end of a face, we will draw an arc of a circle. From the other point, we'll make another, and the section point will determine the vertex of the triangle. We will draw on the lathe, and with a barley grain placed at this point a circle in which all the vertices of the angles must meet, if we have operated correctly.

  To make the triangular grooves, we will grip the cylinder in a vice between the wood clamp, and we will first use a saw with medium teeth, which we will drive far enough from the line to be able to register with

Page 65
Pl.12.

a three-sided ecouane, a little thin, equal in all its length; : this ecouane should only be toothed on two sides, so as not to go deeper than you want; and for this we will hold the toothed part that is not used, above: thus the smooth side bears against one of the sides of the corner; and since the attention is not directed to the other, there is no fear of cutting into the one that is not being cared for. We will draw each side of the triangle, until we reach the line. It is important, in this operation, that the two sides are perfectly drawn up along their length; otherwise the pieces of wood that we put in it would not fit exactly, and, making a spring, would vary under the tool.

  To make with a plane or a miter the triangular pieces which must be put in the grooves of such shape, there are several ways that we will not indicate, so as not to throw ourselves into too long digressions. The simplest would be to make them with a varlope, on a carpenter's bench; but the inclination of the angles makes these pieces very difficult to work in this way, unless you are very accustomed to handling carpentry tools.

  You can make a triangular notch on a rather strong piece of wood, or to put it better, the shape of the pieces you want to work. After having carefully traced it, we will rough it with a saw like that of the cylinder; and to finish it we will use a squadron similar to the previous one. It only needs to have the tang bent, so that the handle does not interfere with the operation. See fig. 13, the notch in perspective, and in section, fig. 14. When we have roughed the parts roughly to the shape they should have, we will finish them on the notch, as we have taught for square parts. Finally, there is one last method, longer, more difficult and more meticulous than all the others, which we would not detail here, if it could not be employed in an infinite number of circumstances, and which has been perfectly successful for us for various purposes. compass yards, three sides of which are at right angles, and the fourth forms a line broken by an obtuse angle.

  This last means consists in making a kind of guillaume that we are going to describe.

  Two small hardwood boards, four inches wide by eight long, and the thickness of which should be equal to half of one of the sides of the pieces which are to enter the grooves, should be perfectly erected with a plane. We will put them one on top of the other, flat on the workbench,holding them securely under one or two jacks; one will have drawn before on the interior face, and on the length of each one with a gauge, a line parallel to the bank, at a distance equal to the perpendicular lowered from the top of the triangle formed by the groove on its base.

---
Page 66
Pl.12.

  Of these two boards thus placed one on top of the other, the one above will be placed just on the line that has been drawn on the other, so that when we take the wood, up to the line of the one above , they both appear to be only a thirty degree inclined plane. We say thirty degrees because these two boards having to mate, the union of the two angles of thirty degrees will give that of sixty degrees, that is, the angle of the equilateral triangle. This operation must be done with great accuracy and precision, and the inclined plane must be straight in all directions. When we have made sure, we will remove these boards from under the valet; then taking, with a false square, the inclination to give to a William's iron a little upright, that is to say less inclined than forty-five degrees, ordinary inclination of carpentry tools, we will trace, on the inside face of each board, a groove suitable for containing the tail of the iron, and a wedge of wood to clamp it in place; and care should be taken that with the iron in place, either 1/3 of the tool's length across the front or so. The top should come out halfway a, fig. ii; so these two grooves must, applied one on top of the other, become one. Give each for depth half the width of the shoe. We will appropriate them well; then heating a good glue, and the two interior faces of the boards, we will glue them one on the other, taking care that the two inclined planes which have been practiced there relate perfectly in all their length, in at the same time as the grooves fall on top of each other, and seem to be one. See fig. 11 bis, where the tool is represented on its thickness and by the end. This operation is long and difficult; but it provides a very convenient tool in the present case and in many others; we will leave the room half a day, more or less, under the valet, so that the glue sets perfectly. It will even be good, so that the pressure is not made in one place, to put on top, and under the dough of the valet, a well drawn board, which also presses in the whole length.

  When everything is very dry, we will give, in the direction and along the length of the groove intended to receive the blade, two saw cuts at the bottom of the tool, to place the broad edge of the blade, which we are going to talk about. ; and we will realign this slit, which we call L 'mière, very properly, so that the iron, being in place, poses everywhere, and that there is very little daylight above, between the iron and the iron. the wood, so that the chip comes out cleaner, and does not engage. We will form, on each side, a very conical eye, the truncated vertices of which meet, as can be seen, fig. 11, to empty the chips, by putting your finger in them.

---
Page 67
Pl.12.

  We will forge, or we will forge ourselves an all-steel guillaume iron: we give it exactly the shape of the groove, resulting from the meeting of the two inclined planes, the bevel will be placed below, as in all planes. See fig. 12.

  We see on each side of the tool (on the section, fig. 11 bis), two iron rulers, which have the ability to rise and fall, depending on the width that we want to give to the rod: the holes that give passage to the screws are oval in the direction of the width, and the screws are with bolt head, to retain the rulers at the point where they were put, by means of a wing nut: these same rulers can be in some hard wood, like cor¬mier or alizier.

  In the operation which occupies us at the moment, these rulers or cheeks are of no use, and must remain fixed so as not to exceed the end of the iron; but if we wanted to form an angle on the apex of a parallelogram, such as that of the shank of a com¬pas, we would stop them so that they would exceed the iron by all the height we would like to leave on the other sides of the parallelogram.

  We will prepare with the varlope, as many pieces of wood as we need, or better still, if we want, for example, eight of eight inches long, which makes five feet four inches, we will make them in two. parts of two feet eight inches each; and this method, easier and shorter, presents at the same time more perfection. We should try especially to draw up one side perfectly: we will then draw up, as exactly as possible, one of the surfaces of a piece of frame, three to four inches wide, to a thickness at will, or a somewhat thick board and of very dry wood. We will put on the length of the well erected face, of each piece, a few flies of goodStick a little clear, and we'll stick them on the board, two inches or so away from each other. They will be secured in this position either with valets or with wooden presses; but care should be taken to ensure that very little glue remains there, lest this thickness adversely affect the uprightness of the part. Nothing will then be as easy as forming the other two sides, using first a guillaume, to cut down the upper angles; then we will finish with the tool we have just described, but with a very small iron. , lest it graze.

Page 68
Pl.12.

  When both cheeks rest on the board, then the tool will no longer bite, and since it is assumed that this board is perfectly erect, the rod cannot fail to be straight. We will then cut each part to the length it should have, and we will realign them perfectly to the square, by that of the two ends which ondestine to pose against the plate of the cylinder, as we said it.

  If we did not have enough use of working with a plane, to perfectly dress the square rods, which we spoke about in the previous section, we could, following the example of the method we have just discussed. 'teach for the triangular, and which has succeeded us perfectly, nail on the sides of a good standing plane, hardwood cheeks, the projection of which from below was equal to the thickness that we want to give to the trin ¬gles; and even because of the protrusion of the iron, we will make that of the cheeks a little stronger; and the rods would be glued successively on two contiguous sides.

  This method is very good in itself; but if the operation is repeated often, the plane will soon find itself riddled with nail holes that have been found there. It is better to drill the plane across its width, two inches or about from the ends, with two holes three lines in diameter, and insert two bolts, the ends of which are tapped to receive wing nuts. The cheeks will be pierced at corresponding points with holes of the same diameter, which will be extended as much as we want over the width of these cheeks, so that they can be placed at the height required by the thickness of the different rods which 'we will want to train among them. These cheeks will be retained at the point where desired by tightening the nuts.

  We won't repeat anything we said about how to deflect those triangular pieces. It's still the same operation, the same precautions and the same way of retaining the rods on the cylinder.
*** SECTION VI. Rotate Columns, Vases, Balusters, flat oval.

  These kinds of parts turn like the previous ones on a cylinder except that the grooves, instead of forming a square or a triangle, must present a rectangular parallelograme, the width of which will be determined.

undermined by that of the pieces we propose to shoot. The depth should be half the thickness of these parts.

  We will prepare a rod having the proposed dimensions; and one of the means indicated in the preceding Sections will be employed for this. We will cut it into as many parts as we need; we will draw up the ends perfectly, and we will place them in the grooves, where they will be retained by the circles or links of which we have spoken.

  In this state, it is only a question of giving on the Tower the shape that pleases the best, such as a column, with base and capital, following as far as possible the principles that we have taught in our first Volume; but always cut the wood at an angle to avoid tearing, burrs or splinters.

  It is still more difficult to turn the second side of the column. We will turn all the pieces upside down and secure them with the circles or ties. We also recommend to make sure that the ends are touching exactly against the plate placed to the left of the cylinder; this is of the utmost importance. And it is good to notice here that if each groove was not perfectly parallel to the axis, and if all their edges were not parallel to each other, the moldings would never match, since the pieces would have been presented. a little at an angle, compared to the tool which always cuts perpendicular to Tax.

  What increases the difficulty of this second operation is that the capital and the base being protruding from the shaft of the column, there are only these two ends which rest in the groove, and that the body of the column is at some distance. It is therefore necessary to cut very lightly, first with a very sharp long gouge, and in olive; then use a chisel held at an angle, otherwise the coin will soon be torn and full of scratches; another difficulty to overcome is the chattering of the wood, which only rests at the ends, comes out under the tool. We will therefore take infinitely little wood at a time. Patience and skill are the great masters for such works. There is shown, fig.16, a column thus turned, its thickness, fîg. 17, and its cross section on its diameter, fig. 18.

*** SECTION VII Turn triangular and crawling between two points.

  The idea of ​​turning parts by the methods we have just reported must necessarily have given that of placing them obliquely on the cylinder, and from there, the creeping shape they take there. This new operation requires a few details.

  We will prepare a cylinder, fig.19, like the previous ones; and before attaching the small board we have spoken of, the notches must be completely finished. When the cylinder is perfectly round, we will divide it into two equal parts along its length, by a circular line, and we will mark on this line as many points equally distant, as we want to make grooves. We will lead by each of these points parallels to the axis leading to the two faces of the cylinder. O11 will then mark on the circumference of one of the faces a point to the right, and on the other a point to the left of each of these parallels, and at an equal distance. This distance determines the more or less rampant of the baluster, and it is on the inclined line, led from one of these points to the other, that the saw cut is given indicating the axis of the triangle formed by the groove. ; but it should be observed that this saw cut is in the direction of the radius only in the middle of the length of the cylinder, where this cut intersects the parallel. We will therefore draw at the two ends of the parallel, on the two faces of the cylinder, a straight line in the direction of the center, and at the two ends of the inclined line, we will lead two parallel to these radii, of an indefinite length, on which will determine the depth of the saw cut which must be proportioned to the width of the balusters. We will then lead two parallel to the inclined, separated by half the width of the balusters; and from the points where they will end on the two faces of the cylinder, we will lead two lines to the point indicating the depth of the kerf, and these two lines will give the direction of the triangle of the groove.

  After these arrangements, we will put the cylinder in the vice, with the pliers, for fear of spoiling the surface; then with a good fine-toothed saw, and well dressed, we will first remove all the wood included in the triangle, leaving the lines outside, and then we will properly register the notch with a chisel, and we will finish it off. give the shape it should have, with skins, as we said in the previous section, and using a gauge of wood similar to the pieces prepared for balusters.

  These parts are absolutely similar to those used for the triangular balusters, and therefore are prepared in the same way.

  By means of the obliqueness of the grooves or grooves, one should not expect to see them equal in depth throughout their length. If we wish to ascertain the cause which produces this effect, it will suffice to cut any cylinder obliquely along its length, and we will see that the cut presents a curved line which is nothing more than a portion. helix: thus, although these grooves are perfectly straight at the top of the angle, which is the bottom, and the two ends are equal and calibrated, the middle will be much deeper; and the greater the inclination of the groove, the more this difference will be noticed.

  We will turn the balusters or other models, in the way we have detailed above; and as the wood is oblique, it must be cut even more carefully, delicately and lightly, otherwise the angles would be scratched.

  When the first side is finished and polished, the piece will have the shape shown in fig. 25, where the moldings are oblique along its length. The adjoining side, fig. 26, of the baluster, ^^. 23, must be worked in the opposite direction.

  For this second side, we must make another cylinder, ^. 20 and 22, where the grooves are inclined in the opposite direction. This second cylinder is even more difficult to make than the first, because the inclination must be the same, the grooves absolutely similar, and the diameter perfectly equal. It is therefore infinitely more convenient to sei'vir a cylinder of a large diameter, and on which 011 can join the rods, in the two directions to which it is then much easier to give an equal inclination . Besides, the faces of the balusters, being taken on a much larger circle, present an almost flat surface.

  We see from fig. 2Ô that what remains of wood at the two ends of the baluster is essentially necessary to preserve: because the shapes of the part, by reducing its diameter, would not allow this part to fill the grooves, and so they would not be contained therein, neither solidly nor regularly; instead that the circles which maintain them have always taken on parts whose shape does not change panointed.

Pl.12.

  Along with the difficulties we have spoken of in cutting wood clean, there is a new one; that of getting the moldings properly connected, and it is not small. We will go in very small strokes from the angle of a chisel that cuts perfectly. If the faces of the part are very regular, following the triangle that has been drawn, if the grooves are very similar, although opposed in inclination, the moldings must relate; and we will see that it is not enough that the angle of the vertex, formed by the meeting of the face already made, relates to that which is made at this moment, for the part to be regular: because the third side, to be straight, must connect the moldings; and the slightest inclination, more or less, opposes this connection. We will not stop at any of the details of the operation: they are sufficiently set out above.

  For the third side, we will make a third cylinder of the same diameter as the other two; the triangular grooves will be parallel to the length of the cylinder; and to better adjust them, we will use the same caliber as for the inclined ones.

  To regularize all these grooves, we will use jaws, appropriate to their different shapes.

  If the cylinders have been well made, if the grooves have been absolutely similar, finally, if we have operated with dexterity, the moldings must meet on all three sides. If we found that it was infinitely short, we could put small card blades on the side where there would be too much play; because in all these operations the parts must be tightened by ties or collars.

  Nothing is so singular as a flat column, as we have described it, whose base and capital are creeping, and the shaft is straight.

  To obtain this effect, we turn the base and the capital one after the other in two flat grooves, inclined in opposite directions on the same cylinder, the same groove is used for the corresponding faces of the base and the capital, we will make the base by placing the column in the groove, so that the middle of the top molding is at the midpoint of the cylinder; and for the capital it will be placed so that the middle of its lower molding is at the same point. This will prevent the excessive torsional movement that would result if the column was positioned so that it fills the length of the groove. We will then make the barrel by placing the column in

a flat, straight groove; but previously we had to clear enough space below the moldings so that by turning round the railing could be connected with the round part without risking catching the moldings.

  A rather spicy effect of the Tour is a triangular baluster, turned crawling in one direction up to the line, which marks the middle of it, and in the other direction on the other half, as seen in fig. 28. We feel that each half should be turned on three cylinders, and the other on the same three cylinders in the opposite direction. These two parts must be linked by a groove, as can be seen in the figure.

  When all these pieces are finished, the excess wood is cleanly cut off from each end, so that one cannot suspect how they were turned.
*** SECTION VIII. Easier way to make all the cylinders that are turned on Square, Triangular, Double-sided, etc. Pieces.

We have not been able to conceal from our readers that square, triangular, flat, creeping or straight rod cylinders are very difficult to make; that the accuracy of these grooves depends on the accuracy of the parts you want to shape them; and in order to achieve it more surely, we have given the idea of ​​different tools, which, by hastening the operation, help to make it more perfect. Here are other, quicker and safer ways of making these very exact mandrels or cylinders.

  We will make a cylinder similar to those previously described, but the diameter of which must be reduced by the entire depth of the canes, and even a little more, if we want to perform crawling pieces. At each end of this cylinder, make a span two inches in diameter and six lines in length.

  A round board will be fitted to each span which has the diameter of the body of the previous cylinders, and so that these boards can be turned more exactly, they will be fixed against the shoulders by means of three wood screws each. When they are perfectly rounded, we will mark on the edge of each a line parallel to the axis, and in the same direction, to serve as a reference point, and we will remove them from their place; then

---
Page 74 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.12.

they will be joined together, using the same screws placed in the same holes. To join them more evenly, one will make sure that their circumference relates exactly, by putting them both on one of the staves of the cylinder, which, for this purpose, must be equal, or better still on another cylinder than 'we will have shot separately and with a diameter equal to that of the staves. We will divide these two boards, which can be four or five lines thick, with the greatest care, as we did the ends of the cylinder: we will mark triangles, squares, flat grooves, etc. as with cylinders. Then grabbing them in the vice, we will hollow out the wood included in the grooves.

  To give exactly the same depth to all these grooves, iPfall, when the first one is finished, draw a circular line with a barley grain which will determine the points where they must all end. After this operation, these plates will be put back on the cylinder surfaces, where they will be securely fixed, aligning the splines exactly to each other, if the parts are to be placed on the cylinder, parallel to its axis. For this, we will use the lines that we will have previously drawn on the edge of the boards. The pieces will be held in place by means of two clamps, as we said for the first method, by placing these clamps on the trays.

  When we turn these same parts on the cylinders of which we have spoken, we cannot hope that they press on the bottom of the groove, that by making the first face, the moldings which are practiced there, prevent them from wearing other than on both ends when turning the other sides; thus the disadvantage that one might find in this last method is no longer one; and this has the advantage of being easier and safer.

  This advantage is even more pronounced when you want to turn crawling. Because, assuming that the grooves of the two plates are exactly the same, it is enough to turn one of the two, to the right or to the left, to obtain the obliquity that you want. It is only necessary, in this case, to align with a ruler the thicknesses, which are no longer opposite each other, decrease in width, because of the respective obliquity. To do this, use a rasp or a skimmer, and finish with a somewhat rough file, until the outside angles of the two plates line up perfectly.

  When turning these kinds of pieces, and especially with two, three, four, or more sides, nothing is as difficult as getting the

chisel moldings. To perform them with more regularity, at the same time as with ease, one would do well to use the molding tools, the description of which we have given and taught the use of in the first Volume, in the Chapter of the Columns. This is the only way to achieve perfection; but it must be used with great care, otherwise the wood will be torn from the part where the tool leaves it, especially when the angle is very acute, as in a two or three-sided part.

** CHAPTER III. Some small works which are carried out with the help of the Tower in the air.
*** SECTION ONE. Ladies' requisites.

  The objects that we are going to discuss in this section do not present great difficulties for a somewhat experienced Amateur.

  To execute them, it suffices to know how to put a piece in a mandrel, and to cut the wood with neatness; but as they would have no value if their forms were not exactly rendered, and the moldings made with precision, we thought it necessary to place the description of them only in the second volume, so that people who want to occupy have already acquired a certain habit of work.

  All these small objects are for the use of ladies, and chosen from among those whose shapes seemed to us to present the most elegance. So by providing Amateurs with the means to practice usefully on the Tour, we will put them in a position to make presents that are more enjoyable to offer, than they will have performed themselves.

  Fig. 1, Pl.13, is a purse mold which is usually made of Spanish boxwood. We dig it into its interior, following exactly the exterior shape, and we leave it only two lines of thickness at most. Towards the edge are drilled three rows of holes A, arranged in staggered rows, which serve to fix the first threads. The figure shows the shape to be given to it on the outside, and this piece exhibiting nothing special in its execution, we do not think we should dwell on it any longer.

  Fig.2 is another purse mold, different from the previous one; it is additionally pierced, and bordered at the top, by a row of teeth

---
Page 77 CHAP. III. Sect. I. Ladies' Kits.

used to form stitches, which have a lot to do with knitting.

  As the work progresses, the purse descends into the interior of the mold, and exits through the opposite opening; and when we judge that it is long enough, we form the bottom, closing its end with a silk thread which passes through the first row of stitches that we have made.

  We will not yet say anything in particular about the manner of turning the body of this mold, the shape of which can be seen in the figure. As for the teeth, they can be taken from the piece that was used to form the body, or bring in A an ivory circle on which they will be detached. This last process should be preferred, especially if the body of the mold is made out of wood from the islands, the color of which contrasts nicely with that of ivory.

  Whatever method you decide on, you have to start by determining the length of the teeth, using a very fine and shallow line of barley kernel. We will then draw forty-eight lines starting from the edge, and falling perpendicularly on the barley grain line. At a small distance from each of these perpendicular lines, we will lead forty-eight others, equal and parallel to the first. By this means we will determine the thickness of each tooth; we will space all these lines equally between them, using the platform to be divided, with which the tower must be provided. Otherwise, a compass is used for this operation.

  We give a bit of a drill between the bases of these little parallelograms intended to form the teeth, and we will finish removing the material which separates them with a very fine spring saw. We will finish each tooth by giving it a conical shape, as seen in the figure, using small rasps and rounding files, after which we will polish them with horsetail in water, with great care, to do not alter their forms.

  Fig. 3 is a cross section of a small kit containing a dez and a case, and on the outside in the shape of an acorn. The two parts of this kit are usually made of wood of different colors, and are joined at points a to by a screw.

  To make the lower part which we will call the Cuvette, by analogy with the cuvette of a box, we will climb on the Tower in the air, in an ordinary mandrel, a small cylinder of reddish wood, such as coral, amourette, etc. We will drill in the center, with a spoon bit, a cylindrical hole, more or less deep, depending on the height of the dez that we

Page 78 TURNER'S MANUAL,
Pl.13

wants to place it, and it will be widened with a round tool, until it has reached the shape determined by the figure. We will then make the staff a, on which we will make a screw with a very fine pitch, such as that of the last pitch of the shaft. After that we rough the outside, which we will give the shape of an acorn, bringing as close as possible to the portion gripped in the mandrel, from which we will detach the bowl, thus prepared, with the angle of the chisel.

  Now we have to deal with the lid, for which we will take a cylinder of brown wood, such as gaiac, ironwood, or other, if we have made the bowl in red wood. We will ride it in the same way on the Tour in the air, andwe will start by drilling it in the center, with a cylindrical hole equal to the diameter of the case we propose to place there; then, with a tool with a round side, we will widen a portion of this hole to the inside diameter of the bowl, and we will round the bottom, as seen in the figure. This hole ends with an interior bearing a little smaller than that of the bowl, and carrying a similar screw.

  We will take advantage of these two threads to mount the bowl on the cover, without disturbing the latter of the mandrel, and thus finish the part on the outside, by approaching very close to the cylindrical hole drilled in the center of the cover, and intended to give passage to the case. Then separate the finished part from the portion gripped in the mandrel, still using the angle of the chisel.

  A small ivory or ebony button is sometimes placed on the lower part of the acorn. In this case, before separating the cover from the mandrel, a small cylindrical and shallow hole is drilled in this part, into which the end of a very thin and very short ivory or ebony rod is glued, and we turn the excess part in the shape of a ball, pear, or any other.

  We will not talk about the holster we taught to do in Volume One. This one, being of a very small diameter, requires to be worked with great care, especially if one wants to add a groove and ivory threads to it, as is usually done.

  As for the dez, which we have not yet had a chance to discuss, we believe our readers will not be sorry to find some details here on how to turn it and practice the holes that cover its outer surface.

  We take a small solid ivory cylinder, of suitable length and diameter and chosen from a piece of quarter, otherwise the core of the tooth

Pl.13.

would be in the center, and the end of the dez would be drilled to day. We put it in an ordinary mandrel, grabbing it by one of its ends; and we dig it on the Lathe, making first in the center, with a bit of carp tongue, a round hole at a depth equal to that of the dez. It is then given the appropriate diameter and shape, using a round tool, similar to that in fig. 6, Pl. 12, T. I.

  The workers who deal exclusively with the manufacture of the dice use a special tool for this operation, the shape of which can be seen in fig. 24. The cutting starts at point a, and ends at b y the other side of b in c, which must not cut, is rounded and even polished. Present the b end to the entry of the hole drilled with the bit, and set the Lathe in motion until the tool is at the bottom. At this point, he stops cutting, and the dez is finished inside.

  Usually, dices are made from five to six different sizes, and therefore one must have as many tools of different diameters.

  We will mount the dez thus hollowed out on a mandrel, where it will be grasped internally, but without forcing; because this part is very fragile; and since it could rotate while working the outer surface, it will be good to rub the part of the mandrel that goes into the dez with dry Spanish white.

  Then turn the outer surface, following exactly the contours of the inside, and reduce the thickness of the ivory to about half a line, leaving a strip or bead on the edge.

  As it is essential for the regularity of the work that this thickness be exactly the same everywhere, we will use, during this operation, a gauge of tinplate or thin copper, fig. iS, which is easily cut by following the contours of the tool half a line away, fig. 24. If the dez had been hollowed out with an ordinary round tool, it would first be necessary to cut an inside gauge out of a piece of tinplate, which would then replace the tool, 24, for the outline of the outside gauge.

  All that remains is to make the holes that cover the surface of the dez up to about two lines from the bead; these holes are spaced with the greatest regularity, using the platform to be divided, and the carriage support, PL 32 of this Volume, on which is mounted a drill holder, roughly similar to the 'fly tool, fig. 10, Pl. 35. When our Readers have seen the description of this support, they will feel that nothing is more convenient to space the holes very - regularly on the height of the dez and in the direction of its axis. Their distances over the

Page 80 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.13.
circumference are determined in the same way very exactly, using the platform.

  But if one were not provided with a carriage support, which is not found in all laboratories, it would be necessary to draw, with a very fine pencil, circular lines spaced as uniformly as possible, and on which we would make the holes by presenting the mounted dez son a small wooden rod, in front of a drill holder placed in a vice. The wick which is used for this purpose is in carpus tongue, and very fine. We set the drill holder in motion, using a bow, and we observe the spacing of the holes on the circular lines, so that they are arranged in a staggered form.

  We will not talk about gold or silver dez, which are based and terminated by processes known in goldsmithing, and totally foreign to the Art of Touring. The holes in these dice are pricked much like the holes in split platforms. See T. I, page 447

  Fig. 4 shows a pear-shaped kit, made up of two pieces that meet at points a a. These two pieces hollow out and end on the Tower in the air, exactly like those in the necessary fig.3. We only advise to take them, as much as possible, in the same piece, so that the veins and the color relate better, and that the joint is less noticeable.

  We put in this kit a dez, a case, an earpick, a passing needle, and a spool on which we unwind thread or silk. As the shape of this last piece is not known to everyone, we have shown it separately, fig. 26. The interior of the bowl is arranged to receive these different parts, much like the one in fig. 10, which we will detail below, and the cover is hollowed out so as to be able to receive the part that exceeds the edge of the bowl.

  Tail D is made with a twisted aliz tree stalk, or simply rounded with a grater. It is then dyed hot, black or brown, by the procedures described in Volume One, pages 446 et seq., And given its natural shape, by bending it between the fingers before it is cooled.

  With regard to the leaf which is seen in the figure, at ù, it is made with a very thin cut ivory blade, dyed green, and cut in the shape of a pear leaf. At the end of this Volume, you will find a description of an ivory piece, where we explain in great detail how to cut these kinds of leaves. As for the color

Page 81 CHAP. III. Sect. I. Ladies' Kits.
Pl.13.

green, we saw, at the end of the first volume, several recipes for dyeing ivory green and other colors.

  The barrel, fig. 5, is still a kit made up, like the previous ones, of a bowl and a lid, screwed together at points a, a, below the circles. This kit does not differ in any way from the previous one, and it is hollowed out by the same processes. As for the outside, after having brought it to the suitable size, we will use, to make the circles, a tool with a speckle, similar to that in fig. 8, PL 12, T. I, but much smaller . Workers who have a lot of similar parts to make usually use a larger tool, and the edge has several grooves, with the help of which all the circles are made at once.

  The B-bung is nothing more than a small ivory eye, the edges of which are rounded, and which sticks into a shallow bearing, made for this purpose in the middle of the length of the barrel.

  Fig.6 is a lantern-shaped kit; they are made of different sizes, and their garnish varies according to their capacity. The bowl A is turned in the shape of a cylinder, and an ebony torus a is glued underneath, surmounted by a square taken in the same piece, on the surface of which a shallow bearing is hollowed out to receive a reserved tenon in the center of the bottom surface of the bowl. We also garnish the upper edge of this piece with an ebony circle, which is embedded below the staff, on which the cover is screwed. The small mirror C is applied on a very thin wooden tray, similar to that of the body of the lantern, or of another color at will. This tray has a fillet on the other side, in the center of which a shallow hole is dug. After placing the ice cream on the flat side, a wooden or ivory circle is placed on the edge of the board, which covers it and holds the ice firmly. These little pieces of ice of all sizes and shapes can be found at mirror makers: they are always lined with a piece of paper from behind to guarantee the tain.

  This plate fits over the surface of the lantern by means of a dowel, one end of which goes into the hole drilled in the center of the fillet, and the other into a similar hole made in the surface of the lantern.

  The cover B is usually made of wood of a distinct color and darker than that of the bowl. After having placed in an ordinary mandrel, a cylinder prepared for this use, one hollow in the center a hemispherical hole, using a round tool, and one makes on the edge a

carried with a screw that can be mounted on the scope of the cuvette A. We take advantage of this screw thread to mount the bowl, and finish it outside, after having made on one side the hole used to fix the mirror, and on the other two similar holes intended to receive the tenons of the handle E, which we are going to talk about. These last two must be on a line perpendicular to the base, and diametrically opposite to that on which the first is placed.

  When these holes are dug, and the outer surface of the bowl completely finished, we will remove it from above the cover, and we will place the latter in another mandrel, to complete its outer surface, to which we will give the shape of a ellipsoid cut on its small axis, and elongated very little upwards, as can be seen in the figure.

  With regard to the ribs that you see on this cover, they are made by hand, with a three-sided file, using the platform, to space them evenly. All that remains is to make the handle E, which can be cut with a piercing saw, in a board or in a very thin piece of ivory, on which we draw the shape that we want to give it, by y reserving two small studs that fit into the holes we talked about above. This handle, as well as the tray that holds the ice, must be prepared in advance; but we do not put them in their place until the piece is entirely finished and even polished.

  Fig. 7 shows a toilet-shaped kit. This form is usually given to oral kits, which contain a toothpaste, a tongue scraper, a flask, and other small objects intended to maintain the cleanliness of the mouth, which are placed in the bowl, the interior of which is arranged for this effect.

  The lid is surmounted by an ivory or wooden crescent ô, which carries a movable mirror A, fixed like the previous one, with the help of a circle, on a wooden or ivory tray. This croissant is made in the following way.

  We begin by turning a circle of wood or ivory adorned with moldings, at will, on the thickness of which we drill two holes placed at the end of the same diameter, and intended to receive the small screws on which the mirror must rotate. Then divide this circle into two unequal pieces, cutting it above the holes at a distance equal to half its thickness. The small screws are tapped at their end, and mounted in the frame of the mirror. The portion of their shank which passes through the holes drilled on the crescent should be smooth and turn easily in them.

---
Page 83 CHAP. III. Sect. I. Ladies' Kits.
Pl.13

  The spheroid c, which supports the crescent, ends with two screw studs, one of which is mounted on the cover, and the other on the crescent, by means of which these two parts are united.

  It is worth noting that the nut made for this purpose in the thickness of the crescent can only be done with a tap, because of the difficulty of mounting a part of this shape on the L-lathe. 'air.

  You can also garnish these kits with dez, case, chisel, etc. like the ones we described previously. We then give the lid a slightly higher shape and proportionate to the height of the objects that we want to contain. We also remove the crescent, and fix the ice immediately to the cap, mounting the upper screw of the spheroid c in the frame itself.

  It is then customary to fit a skein behind the ice, and for this we give the frame a sufficient width and thickness. We will give in one of the following articles how to make and adjust these balls.

  The urn, fig. 8, is still a kit that we thought we should give the cut, fig. 9, to better understand its interior distribution, which differs a little from that of the previous ones.

  The pedestal b serves as a stopper for the case c, on the throat of which it enters with just friction. This case, which, moreover, does not differ in any way from the others, first passes through a cylindrical hole drilled in the lower part of the vessel, in which it must turn freely. Around the middle of the case is glued a hollow coil e, which receives in its capacity a dez, and around which is wound a favor bearing a linear measure, such as a half-yard or a double decimetre, divided into inches. or in centimeters. The end of this favor passes through a small mortise made on the body of the vase, on the outside of which it is held by an ivory scroll c, fig. 8.

  Pulling this reel rotates the reel, case, and pedestal, until the favor has fully emerged. To make it fit in, we hold the vase with one hand, while turning the pedestal with the other.

  We will now go into some details on how this is done.

  We will always start with the basin, which is taken in a cylinder of wood from the islands, the height of this basin, that is to say, from a to f, fig. 9, and having for diameter, its largest theargeur which is at point a. After mounting it on the Lathe in an ordinary chuck, we will drill a

Page 84 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.13.

cylindrical hole in the center with a drill bit appropriate to the nature of the wood you are using, and you will bring it to the depth you want to give to the cavity, which is to receive the coil e; then, with a tool aside, we will flare it out, and give it the shape we see in the figure. We will practice on the edge has a span with a thread to receive the cover, as well as all the other necessities we have discussed.

  The cover, which is surmounted by a ball, is hollowed out in the same way, and we practice a span with a screw thread on which we mount the bowl, to completely turn the part outside, according to the shape shown. fig.8, approaching as much as possible the part gripped in the mandrel. After which we will drill the hole intended to give passage to the case, and so that it is quite right in the axis of the part, we give in the center a stroke of a very fine barley grain to determine the place of the wick.

  We will then grasp the surface of the cover in another mandrel, to finish the part that could not be reached, and we will hollow out the top in the shape of a shallow spherical cap, to receive the ball. We will give the way of making this ball by describing the necessary fig. io, who wears a similar one.

  We will then take care of making the pedestal that serves as the base of the urn, and at the same time as the cover for the case. For this piece, prepare a cylinder of cut-colored wood with the body of the kit, and a little longer than necessary, and of a diameter a little larger than the pedestal, at its greatest width. It will be mounted on the Tour in the air in an ordinary mandrel to give it the shape shown in fig. 8, after which a hole of sufficient size and depth will be dug in the center to accommodate the throat of the case. This case must have been prepared in advance, and the hole in the pedestal will be made so that the throat is securely held there.

  Square G, which can be seen below the pedestal, is usually made of ebony, and is fixed by means of a staff hollowed out in the center, to receive a small tenon reserved for the lower surface of the pedestal.

  We only have to talk about the coil e: it is, as we can see, a vase of conical shape on the outside as well as on the inside, and taken from a piece of white wood; in the center of the bottom is drilled a hole with the diameter of the case which one passes through it, and which one fixes there with a little good glue: one also fixes on the outside, with a glue fly, one of the , tips of the favor. We then pass the other end through the mortise

practiced on the necessary, and one sticks there the small roll which prevents it from going back inside. Pc.

  Fig. 10 shows a beehive-shaped kit, made up of two pieces, like all those we have spoken of. We will therefore not stop to describe how to turn it on the outside, but we will expand a little on the internal distribution, and what we will say on this subject also applies to the necessary fig. 4, 5, 6 and 7.

  The one we are now dealing with contains a flask, scissors, a case, two coils similar to that in fig. aG, a passing needle, an earpick, and tweezers. These parts are all placed in similar deformed holes, in which they can enter and exit freely. There are two ways to make these holes, one by drilling them in the very wood from which the kit is made; the other by opening them on a wooden disc ', below which we fit kinds of cardboard cases of suitable shape. We will begin with this last method, which belongs more particularly to the art of the gain, and we believe that our readers will not be sorry to find here some notions relating to this art.

  The vase will first be hollowed out on the inside, roughly following the contours of its external shape, and leaving it only thick enough not to alter its solidity. At some distance from the edge we will leave a little protruding reach to receive the puck we are going to talk about.

  This washer, fig. 11, is a piece of light wood, very thin, and turned to the diameter of the interior of the urn on which we make all the openings that we see in the figure, and which are proportioned to the size and shape of the pieces, which must be able to pass through them very freely.

  We will then take a sheet of smooth cardboard, very thin, roughly like the one we use to make the cards, and we will cover it with a piece of silk fabric of a color that contrasts nicely with that of the card. drink. The strong glue which is used in this operation must be a little thick; we will cover it evenlythe surface of the cardboard, which we will let soak for a few moments: after which we will apply the fabric, with precaution, by stretching it as much as possible, and by interposing a sheet of paper between the hand and the stuff that could get dirty.

  We will cut this sheet of cardboard thus covered with silk, and after allowing it to dry well, in parallelograms of the same length as

---
Page 86 TURNERS MANUAL,
Pl.13.

  the parts for which each of them will be intended, we will present these small parallelograms to the corresponding openings of the washer, after which we will begin to roll or bend them according to the shape of this opening. We will finish bringing the two edges together on the part itself, and we will stick a strip of paper on the joint. The bottom is closed with a small piece of the same cardboard cut on purpose, and which is glued in the same way with a strip of paper.

  All these gaskets will be allowed to dry well, and each will be glued in their place, so that their edges are flush with the upper surface of the washer. We will then cover this surface with a piece of cloth similar to the one covering the cardboard, and let it dry perfectly, after which we will clear all the openings with a knife with a sharp point. All that remains is to place the washer thus furnished in the interior of the hive, and to stick it there on the staff reserved for this purpose at some distance from the edge.

  We will now describe the other way of arranging the interior of the kits, by processes which belong more especially to the art of Touring.

  We will dig the basin of the necessary a few lines from the edge, and when the exterior is polished and finished, we will properly draw up the surface which forms the bottom of this kind of facelift. It is on this surface that we distribute the places of all the objects with which we want to fill the necessities, marking a point in the center of each hole.

  If we had an eccentric, nothing would be easier than to dig all these holes on the Lathe, by bringing them successively to the point of the center of rotation, and thus to give them the diameter and the depth suitable for the part that we want. place there. But since we haven't talked about the eccentric yet, and so as not to deviate from the course we've been following so far, we'll teach how to do them with bits.

  Those that are suitable in this operation are the carpal tongue bits, in the shape of the tool, fig. 14, Pl.12, T I; because we assume that the wood we use is island wood, and therefore very hard and not very porous.

 This drill bit will be mounted on the Lathe, in a drill chuck fig.13, PL.29 of this Volume; and, setting the Tour in motion, we will successively present the center of each hole to the tip of the bit, and we will thus dig them one after the other to the width and to the depth

determined by those of the room. All of these holes, except two, are cylindrical, and their bottoms are parallel to their holes. There is therefore no other care to have during this operation than to keep the necessary straight, so that the bit always follows a direction parallel to the axis.

  As for the two others, which are not cylindrical, they are those which receive the scissors and the dice. The first begins with a bit in the tongue of a carpus, with the help of which it is brought to the diameter of the greatest thickness of the scissors, that is to say from the place where the screw that unites the two branches: we will widen the orifice of this hole in one direction with small slugs, so that the rings can come to rest against. O11 will also use the bit in carp tongue to bring to its depth the hole which must contain the dez; after which it will be finished with a drill or bur, the shape of which will be similar to that of the outside of the dez.

  We just have to talk about the ball that tops the lid, and which is made as follows. We turn a kind of small wooden pulley, and we give it a diameter and a thickness such that it can enter freely into the span carved on the cover. Slightly dig its throat, and make one of its sides a little concave, after which we make a hole in the center about a line and a half in diameter. Then take a piece of velvet or other fabric, a little larger than the pulley, the edges of which are tied on the groove with a waxed thread, so that a gap remains between the fabric and the concave face. of the pulley. We fill this void with sound, which we introduce through the hole drilled in the center, and which we stuff well by means of a small stick prepared for this use, after which we plug this hole by sticking a strip of parchment.

  The ball being thus finished, it remains only to place it in the staff which crownsthe cover of the kit, where it is fixed with a little glue.

   There are still a large number of forms that can be given to these kinds of kits. But we confined ourselves to these, which seemed to us the most elegant. Moreover, an Amateur who will have thoroughly understood the details contained in this section will no longer experience any kind of difficulty in executing all the models that can be presented to him, or those that his taste and his imagination will be able to put to him. to create.

*** SECTION II Conjuring tricks.

  Among the means devised to charm the boredom of long winter evenings, we have always distinguished the recreations known as "Tours de Physique amusante". Some of these tricks belong to physics proper, and therefore have no relation to our subject; others are only effects of the skill and subtlety of the conjurer, and are still completely foreign to us; but there are some which are performed with the aid of small instruments prepared in advance, and which no longer require an ordinary skill. It is these little instruments that we will describe in this section, and we hope that our readers will still be grateful to us for having provided them with the means to practice usefully on the Tour, and at the same time to provide their families with objects of quite pleasant recreation.

  We will start with the simplest of these parts, which is the nutmeg box fig. 12, sectional view fig. 13. The conjurer, after placing the box on the table, lifts the lid by grabbing it by the little button on top, and points out to the company that it contains a nutmeg; he ostensibly withdraws it, makes it disappear by putting it in his pocket, or in any other way; then having replaced the cover, he proposes to return it to the box.

  Indeed, after a few insignificant speeches, he lifts the lid again, and the nutmeg reappears.

  This effect is produced by a double cap placed inside the lid, and on the outside representing half of a nutmeg, the rest of which would be contained in the box. By this arrangement we can easily make the nutmeg appear and disappear several times from the eyes of the spectators.

  Now let's see how to turn this piece. We will start by making nutmeg A, fig. i 3, which is nothing more than a ball dyed "black and of the same wood as the rest of the box, for which Spanish boxwood is usually used.

  We will then climb on the Lathe, and in an ordinary mandrel, a piece of boxwood of sufficient length and width to be able to take the cup and the pedestal forming the lower part B.

---
Page 89 CHAP. III. Sect. II Funny physics.

first dig the cup, which has a hemispherical cap, the diameter of the nutmeg, which must come out and enter it freely, but without tossing. We make on the edge a groove a, similar to that of a snuffbox, to which we give little more than a line of height, leaving it as little thickness as possible. We will then finish the exterior, which, as can be seen, fig. 12, is covered with rushes similar to those of the barrel, fig. 5, and which are carried out in the same way with a tool with a duster.

  We will then take care of the cap C, the interior of which is hollowed out so as to receive half of the nutmeg, plus the throat a which enters an interior span made for this purpose on the edge. When this cap is in place, it should represent the nutmeg in the box; it must therefore offer on the outside, first a ring similar to those covering the box, then a groove of the same height as that a; finally a half-sphere, colored the same color as nutmeg, and to create more illusion, it should be left as thin as possible, so that the diameter does not differ noticeably from that of nutmeg.

  Finally we will make the second cap D, and we will hollow it out so that it covers exactly the first, on which it fits by means of an internal bearing, similar to that of the cap C. The outside of this cap is covered with rushes similar to those in the box, and which are executed with the same tool. The top is surmounted by a button in the shape of a vase or a ball, the use of which we saw at the beginning of this article, and which is usually taken in the same piece. We could also glue, in this place and in a hole dug for this purpose, a small ivory or ebony rod, the excess part of which would be turned, giving it the adopted shape.

  To be able, with this piece, to create a little illusion to the spectators, it is necessary that all the parts which compose it are perfectly adjusted one on the other, so that by grasping the small button which surmounts the cover, one removes at the same time the second cap or false nutmeg which remains suspended therein, and thus reveals the real nutmeg, when it is placed in the box. If, on the contrary, you want to update the false nutmeg, you grab the box in your left hand, pressing two fingers on the rod that ends the cap C, to prevent it from leaving throat a. This is partly why the entire exterior of the room is covered with rushes, which have the added advantage of hiding the joints.

  If we have designed what we have just saidfrom the nutmeg box, you can easily perform the egg box, fig. 14, which has the effect.

  The conjurer discovers the box, still grasping the cover by the little button which surmounts it, and points out to the spectators that it does not contain anything; he puts the lid back on, and after a few moments he makes a red egg or a blue egg appear at will, which he can also make disappear.

  This illusion is due to a double inner cap A and B fig.1 5, one of which is painted in blue and the other in red, to which we can add a third painted in white. These caps and the lid which covers them fit in the same way as the false nutmeg and the lid of the box fi g. 1 3; the outside of the room is also covered with rushes, and therefore turns by the same processes and with the same tools.

  Figs. 16 and 18 show the two pieces with which the Turn of the millet is performed as follows.

  The conjurer holding the box in his left hand, Fig. 16, uncovers it with his right hand, and points out to the spectators that it is full of millet to the edge. He then places it on the table without covering it, and suggests sending the millet under the bell, fig. 18, which he places next to it, after shaking the clapper, and showing that it does not contain anything. U covers the box, and after a few customary speeches, he removes the cover using the button above it, and without disturbing the box, which is empty. The millet is therefore gone, but it has not yet reached its destination; indeed, he raises the doorbell, waves the clapper, and there is nothing underneath yet. He covers the box, puts the bell back next to it, and after a few moments he raises it himself or he asks one of the spectators to raise it, and thus discovers the millet spilled on the part of the table covered by the bell.

  This trick produces a certain surprise when performed with a little skill, and can embarrass for a few moments people who do not know the construction of the two pieces, fig. 16 and 18, which we are going to describe.

  Fig. 16 shows the box closed and surmounted by its cover. We see the section, fig. 17. The lower part A ends with a pedestal, the shape of which can be varied at will, and has at the other end a groove a, similar to that of the nutmeg box. This groove receives a span made below a false box B, about a line deep, the outside of which has another similar groove

Page 91 CHAP. III. Sect II. Conjuring tricks.
Pl.13.

at the throat a, which receives the cover, crowned by the button h, the shape of which also varies at will.

  The fit of these different parts is absolutely the same as that of the nutmeg box. The cover must also be a little closer on the throat of the false box, than the lower bearing of the latter on the throat a, so that by removing the cover by the small button, the false box B follows it, and that the real parish box empty in the eyes of the spectators, as it really is. O11 coats the interior surfaces of the false box with glue, which is then filled with grains of millet, which attach to it so that if the cover is removed with the right hand, while keeping the false box on the left hand with your left hand. the throat has, the box appears to be full of millet.

  We will not say anything about the manner of turning these various pieces, which can no longer present any difficulty. The outside of the box is entirely covered with rushes similar to those covering fig. 12 and i4, and the use of which is still the same.

  Now let's move on to the description of the doorbell, the construction of which is a little more complicated, and therefore requires a little more detail.

  Fig. 19 shows the section of the bell. We see in a a cavity made in the thickness of the body, and pierced with two holes passing in the direction of the axis: one receives the end of the handle B, and the other the valve b, which we will soon see use.

  The handle B is made up of two main parts: the body c which is drilled along its entire length with a cylindrical hole, widened from above, as seen in the figure; and the button d, which ends in a tenon the diameter of the upper end of the hole in the body of the handle. An iron rod fixed to the button d, after having passed through the handle in its entire length and the cavity a, receives at its other end the valve b which closes this cavity. A coil spring, placed in the widened part of the hole which crosses the handle, rests against the lower bearing surface formed by this flare, and forces the button d to go up; which drives the iron rod and the valve b f and thus closes the cavity a. If, on the contrary, one presses the finger on the button d, the rod goes down, and the valve which is attached to it discovers the lower orifice of this cavity.

  According to thisThis construction, it is easy to see that, if the cavity a had been filled with millet grains, it was easy to get them out without the spectators noticing; which explains the way.

Pl.13.

which we used to perform the trick described at the beginning of this article.

  To make more complete the illusion which makes all the pleasure of these kinds of recreations, it is necessary that the millet enclosed in the capacity a can be contained in the box fig.16; and for this we will hollow out the inside of the box so that its capacity is a little less than that of cavity a, which must not be completely filled.

  We will now go into some details on how to shoot the various pieces we have just described, and on the precautions that must be taken in order to be successful.

  First of all, one must trace the cut of the piece on the paper, as it is proposed to execute it, roughly as described above. 19, giving it the dimensions and proportions we stopped at. This preliminary feature is used to more easily determine the relative size of the different parts of the bell; it makes it easier to choose, immediately and without fumbling, tools of the size and shape suitable for the operations which we are going to describe.

  We will start by making the body of the bell, for which we will choose a cylinder of Spanish boxwood, a little longer than the height determined on the line we have just made, and whose diameter exceeds that of the edge of the doorbell. We will mount it at the Tour in the air in an ordinary wooden mandrel, and we will rough the outside with a gouge, following roughly the shape indicated in the figure, and approaching as much as possible to the part. grasped in the mandrel, that is to say from the top of the bell. After which we will take a wick, in carp tongue, to drill a round hole in the center of the cylinder, which passes through it in its entire length and on its axis.

  As the upper end of this hole must receive the end of the handle B, care will be taken not to make it too large in diameter, and we will always adjust to the dimensions in the drawing. This hole will then be flared with a wood hook, fig.1, PL 19 of this Volume, which has the effect of the gouge on the outside; and bring it to the shape we see in the figure. We had to determine in the drawing the depth of the interior of the 1 bell, and therefore the thickness of the portion reserved for the cavity "; and to make sure that it is not exceeded in the operation, it will be measured from time to time with the square in a cross, fig. 7, Pl. 2 of this Volume. All that remains is to destroy the ribs formed by the effect of the hook, using a side tool, round at the end, fig. 7, PL 12, T I. If this tool

is sharpened very fond, the part will, after its passage, be finished and almost polished on the inside. We will then present a barley kernel at the orifice of the hole, to flare it so that it is exactly closed by the top of the valve b, whose shape is conical.

  We will remove the bell from the mandrel and we will grab it by the edge in another mandrel, to finish the outside, on which we will make some very fine moldings at will. Then introduce into the hole in the front face of the part, a tool roughly similar to that in fig. 13, Pl. 13, TI, and of proportionate size, with which we will begin to flare the most that we can; and when this tool will no longer be able to reach the material, we will substitute another one with which we will completely hollow out the cavity a. To avoid puncturing, during this operation, the finished surfaces either inside or outside, we will often consider the design, and we will always adjust for the shape and size of the tools we will use, on the material we wants to move.

  After having sufficiently dug this cavity, we will make in its upper hole a nut onto which the handle B is screwed, which we will now deal with.

  This handle is, as we have seen, composed of two parts which can, with the valve û, be caught in the same piece. We will therefore prepare a boxwood cylinder of sufficient length, and the diameter of which should slightly exceed that of the bulge of the handle. We will mount it in a mandrel by one of its ends, and we will make the valve at the other end, giving it exactly the shape shown in fig. 20 which represents this part, seen in large size. The narrowest part of this valve must be outside, in order to be able, during the work, to present there the conical and lower hole of the cavity ", and to make sure that it is exactly closed by the valve, which must make as little protrusion as possible on the interior surface of the doorbell. A very fine and shallow hole will then be drilled in the center, ddesigned to receive the end of the rod from Ler, after which we will detach the valve to take the rf button next, which offers nothing in particular, and which must be drilled in its center with a hole similar to that of the valve, to receive the other end of the iron rod.

  The portion of the cylinder which remains in the mandrel is intended to form the body of the handle. We will first drill it in the center and in its entire length, with a hole the size of the iron rod, and we will flare this hole upwards, with a larger bit, to be able to place the coil spring there. , seen large, fig. 21. We will take care that the bottom

Page 94 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.13.

of this flaring is perfectly drawn up, after which this part of the handle will be turned externally, giving it the shape shown in the figure, or any other, and approaching as much as possible the portion gripped in the mandrel. Then we will turn over the handle, and we will seize it internally in another mandrel by the cylindrical hole, to make at the other end an external screw thread, intended to enter the nut made in the upper opening of the cavity a . We will present this nut to the screw several times during the operation, and we will make sure that it fits perfectly. Finally, we will assemble all these parts as follows. We will first place the end of the iron rod in the button d, and the coil spring in the hole made for this purpose; the rod will be threaded through the handle, passing through the spring to secure the valve at the other end. All that remains is to attach the flapper below the valve, with a wire S, and the bell is completely finished. We do not say anything about the manner of turning this clapper, the shape of which can be seen in the figure, and which does not present any difficulty.

  But we believe it is our duty to teach Amateurs here how to make the coil spring, Fig. 21, which is used in many circumstances.

  Take two strands of wire the size of a fine knitting needle, known in the trade by the designation No. 5. We fix one end of each next to each other in a vice, and we roll them around an iron cylinder with a diameter a little smaller than the hole intended to receive the spring, tightening the turns as much as possible. Then separate the two pieces of wire, and you have two coil springs equally spaced: cut one of the correct length, and save the other for use on occasion.

  Fig. 22 shows a small box called a Baguier, sectional view, fig. 23.

  In order not to deviate from the course we have followed so far, we will first explain the use that is made of this box. The conjurer discovers the box, and after showing the spectators that it does not contain anything, he asks someone from the company to place a ring or a coin in it. Then having put the cover back on, he announces that the ring has disappeared; in fact, when you open the box again, you can't find it. This game can be continued for some time, thus making the ring or the coin contained in the box appear and disappear several times.

  This effect, which still produces enough illusion when the trick is performed with promptness and dexterity, is due to the construction of this small piece, composed, as can be seen, on the cup, fig. 23, of a box A, and its cover B, which meet in a, by a small groove similar to that of a snuffbox.

  The lower part of the box A is solid, and drilled in the center of a round hole, to receive a coil spring, which itself is crossed by a rod holding on one side to the upper part of the pedestal, and on the other to a false movable bottom which covers the orifice of the hole. This hole is not even throughout its length. The lower part which receives the spring is wider than the rest, and ends with a straight surface, on which the spring rests during the play of the machine.

  The cover B is arranged in the same way; the false bottom must be similar in everything to that of the box, on which a very thin wooden disc is placed, and the two surfaces of which do not differ in any way from those of the false bottoms. This washer must be turned just to the diameter of the box and the cover, so that it can remain suspended from the latter, when it is applied to it, by pressing the finger under the pediment; this is the position she should be in when you open the box the first time; and the ring will be placed on the false bottom of the box. Covering the box, push down on the button on top of the cover, and push down the washer that covers the ring, and make it disappear.

  If we understand correctly what we said about the way to turn the millet box and the bell, we do not findra no difficulty in making the ring sizer. The three main parts, that is to say the box, its cover and the pedestal turn outwardly, according to the shape shown, fig. 22, or any other that we find more pleasant. As for the inside of the box, a very fine hole will be drilled in the center, which will be enlarged towards the lower part, to receive the coil spring; after which we will widen the top, to make it look like a shallow box. This operation will be repeated on the cover; and we will then take care of making the false bottom of the box, which has a rod made of the same piece. This rod passes through the lower part of the box and the coil spring which is placed there, and comes to be fixed in a shallow bearing, made for this purpose on the pedestal.

  The false bottom of the cover is absolutely similar to the other, and the end of the rod attaches to the button above it.

  The two false bottoms and the two surfaces of the intermediate washer will be covered with a piece of maroquine paper absolutely similar, which will make the illusion more complete.

  There are still several other pieces with which to perform fun physics tricks, similar to those described in this section; but we do not think it necessary to dwell longer on an article which may not be of equal interest to all our readers. Besides, what we have said will be enough to put an intelligent Amateur in a position to perform all the pieces of this genre that are presented to him, and even to imagine new ones.

** CHAPTER IV. Torso Columns, Archimedean Screws, Serpens.
*** SECTION ONE. Full torsos.

  The most ingenious inventions are often only the consequences of infinitely simple principles: thus, in mechanics, the invention of the pulley, which itself is only a series of levers of the first kind, gave the idea of the communication of movement, and of the direction of forces; and soon the idea of ​​toothing two pulleys gave birth to all mechanical cogs, clocks, etc. etc.

  The useful and ancient art of the clay potter necessarily led to the Tower in the air. The tree's ability to turn between its collars gave birth to the idea of ​​moving it along its length; and hence the invention of screws. From the latter to the torso it was not far; and yet it appears that a means of making them at the Tour was not long since found, since the furniture to which they have been adapted hardly dates back more than a century. It seems that this invention made a great fortune, since we can still see all the furniture, both common and precious of that time, adorned with twisted columns. Today that they are almost entirely proscribed, art has nonetheless taken a very advantageous advantage for works of the greatest delicacy, which are, rightly, the ornament of the most curious cabinets. .

  The torso is executed by the same principles as a very long screw, as can be seen from fig. 1, PL 14 - The shaft of Tour A must have collars long enough to be able to make two turns and half during the propeller stroke.

  Thus, with three-inch collars, which are the most ordinary, one can only obtain propellers of fifteen lines at most. The reason is

---
Page 98 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.14.

easy to feel; each time the rate drops, the piece must make two and a half revolutions, otherwise it is impossible to turn round and catch the threads in such a way that it is not visible.

  If we wanted to make a longer torso in the race than that which could be obtained with the collars of the tree of his Tour, we would have to make a false boxwood tree by the following procedures:

  We will take a cylinder of good boxwood, three inches longer than the shaft of the Lathe, and a little bigger than the spool. The distance between the end of the nose and the groove of the stop key will be marked on this cylinder. On this space we will still measure the distance between this groove and the birth of the thread which fixes the pulley.

  At this last point we will mark the beginning of the reel, to which we will only give half the length of that of the Tour. Consequently, we will gain for the length of the collar on the right half of the coil, the molding which follows it, the hexagon which precedes it, and the screw thread which fixes the pulley. We will give the same length to the collar on the left, after which we will turn this shaft between two points, and we will reduce it to the same size as that of the Tour, reserving only the coil and its beads. It will then be mounted on the Tower in the air to thread the two noses similar to those of the iron shaft. When this false tree is thus finished, - we will place it on the bearings of the Tour, and we will use it absolutely in the same way as the shaft of the Tour, in all the following operations, with the exception of the preparation. parts, which must always be roughed out on the iron tree and before placing the boxwood tree.

  Finally, if we had to execute a propeller, the length of which of the stroke of which was such that the means just described did not provide enough elongation, it would first be necessary to turn a boxwood tree of sufficient length. Then we would remove the dolls from the Tour, and we would replace them with two movable dolls, fig. 2, PL 30, to one of which we would adapt a stop key to hold the tree that we would place on these two dolls. , moving them apart at the appropriate distance.

  Either we use a false shaft, or that of the Tour, we must climb on the nose from behind a copper cylinder, or simply some hard wood, on which is traced a very elongated propeller. We trace this helix by means of a parallelogram of paper, of sufficient size to surround the circumference of the cylinder, according to the method which we have described, T. I, page 307, et seq., And which is represented in fig. 8 Pl 25 of the same Volume. We will make sure of the path that the tree can take

Page 99 CHAP. IV. Sect. I. Full torsos.

on its collars: suppose it is three inches, we will make a cylinder of a little more than three inches. We will draw on a square of paper a parallelogram, having for width the length of the cylinder, and for length its circumference, like that a, b, d, c, fig. 1, PL.15, and we will take care that 1 in 3, and 4 in 6, there are exactly three inches. The surplus a, 4; 3, d, is what exceeds three inches. We will draw the parallel lines 1, 4 and 3, 6. We will divide the space between5, 3, and 4> ô, in two equal parts at points 2 and 5. From point 1 to point 5, we will draw a diagonal, and another which is parallel to it from 2 to 6. Finally from points 3 and 4 1 we will draw on the lines ac, bd, two portions of diagonals parallel to the two preceding ones, and which will end up on the lines ac, bd, where they can, like e4, f3. We will glue this parallelogram on the cylinder, so that the points a b coincide with those c d: the others will necessarily coincide. This will give you about two and a half laps of a creeping line, which, over three inches of travel, will make two laps. We recommend to give the cylinder more than three inches, so that when this cylinder comes and goes, it does not escape from above the knife of which we are going to speak, and which serves as a guide, especially if the descent of the step does a little more than two revolutions at the tree.

  So when this cylinder is on the shaft, if some means forces it to move forward and backward, like screws, it will advance three inches in two revolutions; and the work that will be mounted on the shaft will run the same course. This cylinder, thus prepared, can be used for all twisted columns, either full or up to date.

  We will now provide the means to perform a full torso column, like the one shown on the Tour, fig. 1 and 3, Pl.14; and in section along its length, fig. 4. We will prepare a piece of wood, of sufficient length and size, and we will make at one of its ends a nut, the cut of which can be seen at the bottom of fig. 4, which will be used to mount it on the nose of the tree: when it is in place, we put at the other end a doll with movable points to support the piece, which, without this precaution, would graze infallibly because of its length. We will turn it cylindrically, and we will make at the other end a guide, D, fig. 1, perfectly cylindrical, to which we will give a third more than the length of the stroke.

  We will replace the doll with movable points by a doll with collars e, fig. 1. This doll is nothing more than a bespectacled doll in

which substitutes for the telescope two wooden collars, joined in their vertical direction by a bolt u which crosses them, and fixed to the headstock by the bolt of the telescope.

  To make these collars, take a walnut board one inch thick, Fig. 8, and one inch higher than the center of the Tour. A hole will be made on the Lathe exactly to the diameter of the guide, and then a vertical saw cut will be given, passing through the line S, S, which divides this hole into two equal parts. The two collars are joined by the bolt u, which passes through a hole drilled in the thickness, and at the top of the board; as the collars wear out from friction, the bolt is tightened with the nut on its V-end, and the guide is never hampered in its movement.

  We will put these collars at the suitable height, so that the guide turns on its axis, and perfectly in the center; and secure them with the bolt.

  We will then place under the cylinder B, fig. 1, a doll having the shape of a truncated column or any other, at the top of which is a knife U, under which we put a wedge to keep it high, and whose The inclination is such that it enters the groove of cylinder B, and forces it, as well as the shaft and the work, to come and go, according to the propeller that has been traced there.

  The way to fix the tilt of the knife is very easy. The doll is pierced, along its axis, with a hole of sufficient size to allow a Roman screw to pass, similar to that of the other dolls. The nut is fixed in the upper part C; and when tightening the screw below the workbench, the headstock is secured in place, along with the top, at its tilt. You only have to fix your eyes on the needle so that, while you tighten the screw, it does not disturb itself.

  This doll, which serves several other uses, is made up of two parts c, d, joined at b. At the lower part is an index whose point marks the inclination of the knife with respect to the axis of cylinder B, by means of a blade, a portion of which is divided into parts of the circle. So, having marked o, the point where the knife is placed perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, if we present the knife in this position to a united cylinder, it is clear that the shaft will neither advance nor retreat. If tilted from left to right, the shaft will describe a propeller in the direction of the ordinary screws; if, on the contrary, it is tilted from right to left, the shaft will describe a propeller in the opposite direction, and give a screw to the left. We see by this that this doll is infinitely convenient for making screws to the right and to the

left; and although we are talking about the torso right now, it will not be out of place to give the way to get dScrews of all kinds, since the torsos are only very elongated screws.

  If we want to make a screw on the left with the pitch on the right, we will mount the cylinder bearing this pitch on the nose to the left of the Tour. We will put the doll in it, and we will raise the knife by tilting it appropriately so that it makes the shaft walk according to the inclination of the screw. Great care will be taken in this operation, and notice how much of the division is in the needle. We replace the threaded cylinder by a perfectly smooth tin cylinder, then having put the needle in the point on the other side of zero, also removed from what was on the first side, we will raise the knife, which, starting tin, describe the propeller, and produce the desired pitch. After having described the instruments that are used to make a torso, we will provide the means to perform it. We will begin by roughing the cylinder, and we will bring it to the size of a column of the order we are proposing to execute, leaving at both ends enough wood to be able to take the moldings of the base and of the marquee. Immediately after the base, we will make a groove equal to the diameter of the bottom of the torso, and we will make a similar one below the capital, observing that the latter must be a little less hollow than that of the base, because of the decrease in column. It is on these two gorges that the torso propellers end up when they die.

  We will then lower the stop key, and we will place the doll's knife at the start of the propeller traced on the barrel placed on the back of the Lathe, and at the appropriate inclination.

  Everything being arranged as shown in fig. 1, we will put the support towards the end to the right, and we will present the gouge in the groove, holding it firm enough so that the movement does not disturb the hand, and we will leave it to its own right the portion reserved for the moldings of the capital. After having deepened a little in the entire length of the race, we will move the support back to the left, and we will resume a new length of the race, by tuning what is already done with the current recovery, and we will continue in this way. until we have reached the throat practiced near the base.

  We will repeat the operation until we have brought the spine to the shape it should have.

  It is good, before using the gouge, to present a pencil to the

displacement, and thus draw the line that the propeller should follow. This line will determine the top of the propeller, and will serve as a guide for the tool, which should never bite it. When we have gone deep enough with the gouge, and the surfaces, both the hollow and the relief, agree fairly well, we will give the last stroke with the chisel; and this is the difficult part. You have to take very little wood at a time, hold the chisel at an angle, and to round the bottom of the throat use a somewhat narrow chisel.

  What is more difficult still is to finish the helix at the ends of the column, so that, both the relief and the hollow, end up dying, near the squares a, a, b, b, fig. 3 and 4, without starting them, as OR sees it in these two figures.

  When the torso is finished and polished, we will lower the knife c, fig. 1. We will lift the key to stop the Tour, and we will carefully turn the base and the hatch with the appropriate tools.

  If the column is to be used with others for any building, furniture or other object, part of cylinder D, fig. i, to fix it in its place, and the part will be finished.

  Here is the torso in its simplicity; and if it is only lavished on it, one can say that executed small, with care and neatness, and in some precious wood, it can pleasantly adorn small buildings with which one decorates the cabinets. Let's move on to the composed and updated torso.

*** SECTION II Torsos up to date.

  Figs. 5, 6 and 7 represent different open torsos, which produce a very pleasant effect; here is how we do them.

  We will take a piece of some precious wood, such as ebony, ironwood, amourette, partridge, or other as firm, very dry, very healthy, and without knots, of the length we want the column, base and cap to be. understood. This piece is infinitely more pleasant in ivory, because this material, having much tighter pores, gives the means of making the fillets much finer than on a wooden torso; but because of the high price of ivory, the base and the capital will not be taken in the same piece, and the cylinder should only be the size of the barrel of the column. Apart from that, everything we are going to say in this section can

Page 103 CHAP. IV. Sect. II. Torsos up to date.
Pl.14.

apply equally to wood and ivory, observing only that; ivory is much easier to work than wood.

  After having roughed out on the outside with a gouge a cylinder of the coarseness and length suitable for the column to be executed, according to its height and its diameter, it will be drilled in its entire length with a round with glasses, with a drill bit. carp tongue or other; but as this hole must follow the bulge of the column exactly in its length, we will begin by bringing it almost to the diameter it should have below the capital, which is, as we know, the smallest diameter of the shaft of the column then we will give it internally the shape that it must have, by means of a particular squarer, which it is necessary to make oneself, and of which we will give the description.

  We will turn a kind of boxwood cylinder, fig. 7, Pl. 30, a little longer than the column. Exactly the shape and size of the hole should be given to portion B C, which is exactly the same length. Portion D is a collar followed by a square which is used to set the tool in motion using a left-turn.

  On portion B C, we will make a groove E, F, hollowed out to a quarter of the diameter, into which we will insert a blade of unhardened steel which will be filed along its entire length, following exactly the shape of the cylinder. Then we will remove it, and we will make a chamfer on its outer edge to make it sharp. We will soak it, we will sharpen it, and we will put it back in the groove, which must exceed a little. A groove will be made on the front of the blade to serve to release the chip. Fig. 8, which shows the squarer seen from its end, will clearly show the layout and shape of this groove. When we have finished growing the hole with this squarer, we will practice at its two ends a very fine screw thread, if the column is to be part of a temple or other piece of architecture, or if we want to place on its top a star, a polyhedron, or some other tower part, as seen in fig. 5 and 6, PL 1 4 - These screw threads must never exceed the base or the capital. The piece thus prepared is placed on a wooden rod that exactly fills the inside of the hole. This rod is attached to the nose of the Tour by a nut at the left end; and it’s in this position that it is given the shape it should have.

  As for its length, it should exceed the column by about four inches. This excess replaces the guide which we have taught to use when talking about the full column.

  This guide being placed in the collar doll, we will give the cylinder

Pl.14.

the dimensions and shape of the column, without completing the moldings of the base and the capital. We will then lower the stop key, and we will raise the knife C to trace with a pencil a first helix along the length of the column.

  We will draw a straight line, parallel to the axis, along the length of the column, then we will divide the portion of this line, included between the first two pitches of the propeller we have just drawn, into as many parts as 'we want to have threads in the torso, and we draw new propellers starting with the pencil from each of these new points. We will then pass new propellers next to the ones we just traced. The distance you leave between these two lines will determine the thickness you want to give to the torso fillets.

  It is now a matter of removing the material that is between these threads, while observing however that a small thickness remains, which keeps them all together until the end of the operation. Use a flat, narrow chisel that takes up barely half the distance from one thread to another.

  This chisel must be presented in the direction of the propeller, and for this you must raise the angle to the right; but, unless you have your hand of course, it is not easy to hold the chisel in this position. At the slightest variation, the high angle catches the thread of the propeller and thepity. It is therefore infinitely preferable to thin the end of this chisel on the left by sharpening it, so that it represents roughly the shape of a razor blade, except that it is at the square end that is the cutting edge: with the chisel thus sharpened, we will put all the fillets to the thickness they should have, following exactly the pencil lines, without ever cutting them.

  We will then take care of giving the outside of the fillets the shape that we will have determined, and for more convenience, these shapes must differ from each other, as seen in fig. 6 and 7. At the first is a round rule, accompanied by another rule formed by a circle between two squares. Fig. 7 also shows a square net.

  To make these different threads, we will use the molding tools, of which we have spoken several times, and the use of which is almost indispensable here; for it would be very difficult, not to say impossible, to execute them with ordinary tools. These tools should be sharpened by the same principles as the scissors just discussed, and the moldings on their ends should be tilted in the same direction as the propeller.

  When, using these different tools, we have brought the nets to their

---
Page 105 CHAP. IV. Sect. II. Torsos up to date.
Pl.14.

shape, there will be a small gap at both ends that the tool cannot reach, and which must be completed by hand. The more the molding tools are cut exactly in the direction of the propeller, the more this space will be reduced; however it will always remain on the side of the birth of the pitch at least the thickness of the tool.

  This work is still quite difficult, especially if the moldings are made up of several round or square strips. If you are working on wood, you should use very fine scissors, and small files that come as close as possible to the shape of the moldings. For ivory, small, suitable slippers, hailstones and grelottes are used; but if, as we advised at the beginning of this article, one took the ivory cylinder only the size of the column shaft, and made apart the base and the capital, all these difficulties disappear; because the tool can easily travel the entire length of the propeller, completing its stroke on the spans made at both ends to unite the column to its base and its capital. If we have operated on wood, and if we took the base and the capital in the same piece as the barrel, it is necessary to take care at this time to finish the moldings by lowering the knife, and raising the key. stop to be able to then polish the whole together by the means which we will indicate, and this operation is not easy.

  Care must be taken to alter the liveliness of edges or angles. Small sticks, suitably cut, will be used to penetrate the inside angles, without rounding them, and to polish the projecting angles, without dulling them. If you are working with ivory, cut a small wooden strip in the shape of a sharp chisel, and walk it to the bottom of the angles, using very fine pumice stone, soaked with a little clear water. And since the angle of this chisel quickly dulls, it will often be revived. Then remove all the pumice, and finish with washed Spanish white. If you are operating on wood, you should dilute the pumice stone with oil.

  The fillets being thus polished, it only remains for us to separate them, which is easily done with a very sharp barley grain, with the help of which we detach the small portion of material that we have. let remain by digging with the chisel the space which is between the steps of the torso.

  This kind of film, which holds all the nets while they are being worked and polished, is an indispensable necessity; but you have to leave it as little thickness as possible, so that the part

---
Page 106 TURNER'S MANUAL,
Pl.14.

of the thread which is attached to it, and which cannot be polished, is the smallest possible.

  If you are working on ivory, you can blacken the rod the piece is strung on. We will easily judge, by the more or less transparency, the thickness at which we have arrived.

  The column being completed and mounted on its pedestal, the room intended for this use will be placed on its capital. This piece must end at its lower part with a tenon which mounts on the steps of the screw that had to be made in the interior of the capital, at the beginning of the operation.

  The means that we have just given for performing an updated torso are suitable for a practiced artist. We will now indicate another which can be put to use by a less skilled hand, but which requires the use of a few compound parts, which we will discuss.

  Cylinder B fig. 1, used in the previous operation, is no longer suitable in this one. At the lieu to place it immediately on the screw on the left, it is necessary to first mount on this screw a yellow copper barrel, fig. 10, on which the cylinder fig. 9 is threaded and retained by a nut a, fig. 10, keeping the ability to turn on it, with just friction.

  At the end of this barrel, on the Lathe side, is a base A, to which a pawl C is attached, fig.11; at the corresponding end of the cylinder, is another base or toothed wheel Z), fig. 10 and 11, carrying an even number of teeth into which the pawl enters, which fixes the cylinder at the appropriate point.

  Fig. 11 shows these two parts mounted one on top of the other and viewed in plan.

  Suppose now that the wheel D has 60 teeth: if, after having drawn the first helix, we fix the pawl at the thirtieth tooth, we will have a second helix opposite the first. If we stop it in the twentieth, we will have three, in the fifteenth we will have four, five in the twelfth, and so on.

  To trace the second helices which are used to determine the thickness of each thread, we will repeat the same operation, making at each division turn the wheel by two, three or four teeth, more or less, beyond the first line drawn, according to the thickness that we want to give to each fillet.

  It may be useful to say that every time you spin the cogwheel, you have to lower the knife C.

Pl.14.

  Instead of tracing the various propellers with the pencil and with the help of the ordinary support, we will use a very sharp barley grain, which we will present to the piece on the carriage support, fig. 1, PL 31.

  This support, the use of which is essential for guilloché work, and which we will describe elsewhere, replaces the hand quite well in several circumstances, and particularly in this one. It should only be observed that with this instrument you can only perform cylindrical parts; and therefore the torso spine which will result from the operation which occupies us at the moment will not be able to be regular, because of the bulge which it is difficult to carry out with this support. The tools used with the trolley stand have a particular shape, as seen on the PL 3 x; but their cutting is similar to the others, and must be sharpened by the same principles.

  To trace a torso using this support, we place the very sharp barley grain, fig. 11, PL 3 i, on the tool holder P, and we stop it there by means of the screws of pressure, so that it is slightly flush with the part. We trace the different propellers, by means of the division adapted to the rear barrel, without having to disturb the support for each one. The carriage support is then moved back to the left, to trace the second repeat, and continue in this way until the part is traced in its entire length. We must notice that when we have drawn a propeller, we must
 remove the barley grain backwards, using the return screw G, intended for. this use, to replace it in its first position, at the birth of the neighboring propeller.

 When the part has been completely drawn, it will be executed with the various tools indicated in the previous section, which will be placed one after the other, and in the order indicated on the carriage support, and which will go back like an orgè grain, each time the step goes up. Very regular fillets are obtained by this means; but if we took the base and the capital in the same piece, we will not be able to reach with the tool to their ends, and we will have to finish them by hand as we did in the operation former.

 The carriage holder is not used for polishing, it is more convenient and easier to do with the ordinary holder, and by the methods indicated.

 Either we perform a torso column with the ordinary support, or we use the cart support which we will be sure to teach the use, this operation takes a long time, and we can fear that a

 before it is completed, the wooden rod on which the column is spun comes back, and then the piece is no longer held there securely enough to be able to complete it. We will prevent this inconvenience.
 deny by putting a light fly of clear glue at both ends of the column.

 To remove the rod when the column is completely finished, use a side hook, with which to destroy the places where the glue is located, taking suitable precautions, so as not to damage the threads of the thread that are located inside the base and the marquee.

 There is still a way to firmly fix the column on the rod, it is to practice, at the end to the left of this one, a thread which mounts in the nut made in the interior of the rod. hase. It will be easily unscrewed at the end of the operation, by grasping the basein a small wooden clip, or simply by hand.

  Nothing would be so pleasing, it seems to us, as a small temple similar to the one shown at the end of this Volume, and supported by uncovered twisted columns; but as the delicacy of these columns does not
  not allow you to bear a little heavy, they would have to be threaded on an ebony rod, which would enter the pedestal and the entablature. We could even, instead of a straight rod, place in the interior of these open columns, another full torso, the propellers of which would follow the same movement. The effect would be even nicer and more pungent.

*** SECTION III. Torso-shaped distaff.

  We promised in our first Volume to give in this one the means to make a distaff in the shape of a torso. This stopper rod, fig. 12, PI. 19, T. I, plan view, fig. 13, presents a rather pleasant shape, and can be carried out by the following means.

  We will climb on the Tour in the air a piece of very healthy and very dry wood, which will be shaped on the outside in the shape of a spindle. On its circumference we will trace the propeller by the method we have described for the handle of the knife, T. 7, pag. 228 et seq., Fig. 12, PI. 21, and for this we will draw a circle with six lines from each end. We will divide these circles into a number of even parts, which correspond exactly

  Page 109 CHAP. IV. Sect. III. Torso-shaped distaff.
  Pl.14

  along the axis. A rule made with a piece of a pendulum spring will be applied to the spindle, so that it lends itself to the bulge of the spindle. You will make the same divisions shown for the handle of the knife everywhere, and you will not worry if they are closer together towards the ends than in the middle.

  We will then do the torso by hand, as we have taught, and we will make sure that the tool penetrates everywhere to the same depth. The threads being finished and polished on the outside, a hole will be drilled at the end which will be considerably enlarged in order to be able to introduce circular side tools therein, to then hollow out the core of the spindle. We will introduce, through this hole, bits of different sizes, with which we will drill first, then further; then with tools aside, we will dig a little bit, depending on the outer shape of the spindle. Finally, with the same tools, we will finish removing all the wood, sparing all the more effort, as we come closer to updating the torso. We will start with the end on the right, and we will finish it. We will then go a little further, and always so step by step, so as not to come back forward, since the threads, once isolated, cannot sustain the force of the tool without breaking. We will soon see threads forming equal in thickness, since we assume that we have dug everywhere to an equal depth. As this spindle must receive the end of the rod, we will bring to the hole through which we have hollowed out this part, and which is too large, a piece of the same wood, in which we will make a hole with a nut. It is even simpler to reserve at the end of the rod a base of sufficient diameter to plug the hole.

  To give the distaff the suitable strength, we will screw at the end of the rod, another small rod which crosses the spindle in its entire length. This ends with a small tenon of about 8 lines, preceded by a base. The tenon goes into the hole in the top of the stopper rod, which then leans against the base, prevents the torso threads from sagging, and keeps them in their natural spacing. To increase the merit of the difficulty overcome, we will garnish this stem in the interior of the torso, with a certain quantity of small flowers with their tails, as we will teach elsewhere to do, and which, making the bouquet, will have something deviate to the large diameter of the spindle.

  We could, with a lot of patience, do this torso on the Tour itself, as we have just taught the others to do; but its rapid decrease towards the extremities presents great difficulties. We train

  form the nets on the outside with a mouchette, we would dig the intervals with a donkey's beak, to an equal depth; then with a tool inclined to the shank, we would form, on each side of the threads, a kind of bevel, so that, when we hollowed out, the part could come off more easily and with more clarity.

  The stem of these cattails is not one piece in its length. We can make it with as many pieces as we like, by connecting them one after the other, and by masking the joints with the ornaments: by this means, we can give to each part the perfections of which they are susceptible.

  Archimedes' screw.
  Pl.15

  It must have been noticed, in the course of this work, that we have directed our examples and our models towards objects of utility. It is this utility which characterizes even the amusements of the wise man.

  Those who are curious to adorn their cabinets, while at the same time delighting their leisure time, will no doubt see, with some interest, that we propose to them to execute a machine in which the genius of the Author shines eminently; it is the Archimedean screw.

  Archimedes, inventor of the screw, which is nothing more than a series of planes inclined around an axis, and which succeed each other insensibly, thereby gave to mechanics an agent capable of producing the greatest effort and the most supported. It is natural to think that this Philosopher, having inclined his screw to the horizon, noticed that each of the points of the helix descended below the point where it had been mounted, to then go up again, when the machine on itself; and taking advantage of the natural tendency of all grave bodies towards the center of the earth, he drew from this property a means of making them ascend. Indeed, at whatever point one places a body on the inclined plane, or helix of an inclined screw, if one turns the screw in the direction of its steps, the point where the body is stopped will rise, and by a continuation of the principle of gravitation, this body will seem to descend, by not following the point where it was, and will travel successively through all the points of the helix, until, without having ever failed in the principle of gravitation, it has actually reached the top of the screw. This theory will become sensitive.

  Page 111 CHAP. IV. Sect. IV. Screw (VArchimedes.
  Pl. 15

  The torso is, as we have seen, a screw whose helix is ​​very elongated: thus, everything that is said of the screw is true of the torso, and vice versa.

  Fig. 5, PI. 15, represents a kind of torso hollowed out in a slightly different way from those we have described, and which only serve as an ornament. This difference in the hollow does not change the nature of the part; it only serves to hold a moving body, to produce the effect we are going to see.

  We will turn a wooden cylinder, of any diameter at will, and of sufficient length, so that the groove or hollow thread a> can make around the cylinder at least three revolutions. We will reserve at the end of the cylinder a rod of a smaller diameter, to serve as a guide and support, passing through a doll with collars, as we have said. We will rough this part on the Lathe, and then put it in a chuck on the Lathe in the air. A cannon with a propeller similar to the ones we have described will be mounted behind the tree.

  The end of the cylinder has been shown, fig. 6, in order to show the shape which should be given to the groove A. Its cut must present approximately three-quarters of the circle, so that the ball that is will introduce by its end can travel it in its entire length, and even stop at any point whatsoever, without being able to get out, if we stop moving the machine.

  To dig this groove, we will use a tool of the same shape, fig. 9, but smaller, so that it can be inserted easily. Finally, this channel will be perfectly united with horsetail or otherwise, so that no obstacle stands in the way of the race of the small ball.

  You can, if you want, make on the same cylinder two or three and even four channels similar to the previous one. When the cylinder is finished, we will cut the end that we had reserved for end A, to serve as a guide, and we will take exactly the center of it, which we will deepen by four or six lines with a rather fine bit. We will turn the cylinder in a mandrel to make such a center at the other end. Then, with a file, you will make an iron plate, or better still a thin steel plate a, fig. 6. We will drill in the center a hole suitable for receiving a round rod, also of steel 6, which just fills the hole we made in the center of the cylinder, and which we will leave to exceed by five to six lines, to form a journal or axis on which the cylinder rotates. The plate will be fixed to the cylinder with four small, very fine nails, with countersunk heads, so that they are flush with the plate. We

  ---
  Page 112 TURNER'S MANUAL,

  at the other end A-, fig. 5, such a journal; but we will practice at the end, with a file, a square suitable for receiving the crank B.

  It’s just a matter of making the kind of trestle the piece is mounted on. This trestle is nothing more than a small cleat C, assembled with a tenon in the sole D. This sole is also assembled with a tenon in the cross member E, serving as a sole for the feet of the trestle. The journal A is carried in a circular notch, made in the middle of the length of the bed base F, and obliquely on its upper surface. This part is fitted in the mounts G, H, which enter with studs in the crosspiece E and to prevent  the distance that the obliquity of the cylinder could cause to the trestle, it is retained by means of the link I, assembled in the cross member K and in the sole D.

  The height of the two mounts G, H, is determined by the length of the cylinder, and by its inclination on the sole D. This inclination is more or less strong, depending on whether the propeller makes more or less revolutions around the cylinder; in all cases it should not exceed 50 degrees, nor be below 40 degrees: at this last inclination the result is already very little.

  If we turn the crank, and consequently the cylinder from left to right, a ball ù, starting from the bottom of the groove, will arrive at the top in two and a half turns, for the sole reason that it has always sought to descend, which is about to explain.

  In the position where the cylinder is shown, we see that the ball b is not in the place where its gravity must make it stay, since the part e of the groove is lower than that where the ball was placed. It must therefore descend there; and already, in relation to a horizontal line, it is lower than it was at first.

  Suppose we make the tree make one eighth of a revolution, the point e, where the ball had descended, will rise to the height of ù, and therefore the ball will have to descend to the point which will have replaced that e. Another eighth of a turn, and everything we have just detailed will have to happen again; but then the ball will have reached, at some point of the groove like y ', which is higher, in relation to the horizon, than e. The same reasoning can be applied to the entire length of the cylinder; from which it follows, that if it were possible for such a screw to have its top at one hundred feet of elevation, the ball would achieve it without any difficulty.

  If we turn the cylinder too fast, so that the ball does not have the

  ---
  Page 113 CHAP. IV. Sect. IV. Archimedes' screw.

  time to descend to the bottom of the groove, it would be carried much above by the centrifugal force: this is what we made evident by representing the ball at point g.

  If, instead of one groove, we made three or four, we could see as many balls go through the grooves, and each go up to the top of the screw. We will follow, to make these grooves, the principles that we have exposed by teaching to make the torsos with several threads.

  As soon as the ball has reached the top of the cylinder, it comes out of the groove, and falls. It must be put back at the bottom of this same groove to give it a new stroke; and when there are four, it's a pretty boring occupation.

  Here is how we can prevent this inconvenience.

  When the cylinder is still only rounded on the Tower in the air, it will be drilled along its length with four holes b, c, d, e fig. 6, at an equal distance from the center and facing each other grooves; then when the four grooves are made, we will drill at the top of each A, a hole inclined to the axis of the cylinder, and which will give in the longitudinal channel closest to this groove, and at the bottom, a hole also inclined to the axis, which also ends in the groove, and the same conduit along the length. The beginning of these holes will be flared to the extent possible; and when the ball has reached the top of the groove, it will enter the solidity of the cylinder, follow the channel, and come back to the bottom of the groove, to start a new stroke. Thus, as long as the four balls pass easily through these channels, it will suffice to turn the screw, and the balls will rise and fall on their own. When these conduits are finished, we will properly plug their orifices and their communication with the propellers, by placing a board on the two ends of the cylinder, to prevent the balls from escaping, and to mask the means by which they come to resume the groove from below.

  This is just an object of curiosity suitable to adorn the cabinet of an Amateur; but it nonetheless demonstrates the principle on which Archimedes' discovery is founded, and which has been applied to very advantageous uses on a large scale. It is by this means that we raise the water to a certain height, and that we dry out in constructions on stilts, or in foundations where water abounds. But then the construction is not the same.

  On the circumference of a strong tree, we describe two or three propellers whose revolutions are quite large, like eight or ten,

  ---
  Page 114 TURNERS MANUAL,
  Pl.15

  over a length of twelve feet or so. A square groove at least one inch deep and perpendicular to the axis is made along 5 * each helix. We build two or three partitions of oak planks, which overlap one on the other, and which are fixed in this situation with screws. Their end enters the grooves of the cylinder; and since the circumference of the axis, shaft or core, isless than that of the cylinder when it is completed, it is understood that these boards must be a species of isosceles and mixed triangles. The two equal sides form two equal straight lines; their top is truncated by a portion of a curve similar to the bottom of the groove. The base has another portion of a circle determined by the inclination of the propellers and the size that we want to give to the cylinder. When these planks have formed, around the shaft or axis, two or three partitions having the form of a helix, the whole is closed externally by narrow planks, which form a very long cylinder or sort of barrel, equal in size. in all its length, and in the interior surface of which also enter with grooves the circular ends of the boards forming! ttaehce. So when the whole thing is put together, there are two or three channels flowing around one another, like the wicks of a screwdriver. You should paint in oil, and in several coats, or tar the inside of these channels to preserve the wood. Several iron rings or circles are placed along the length of the cylinder to contain the fence boards. And by means of the fact that the cylinder is enclosed in a square wooden cage, composed of four montans, assembled along their length by several crossbars, and by the ends, by a cross also of wood, in the center of which pass the two journals. , it suffices to place the lower end in the lowest place of the space which one wishes to use up, and to incline the machine against a scaffold strong enough to contain six or eight men who turn the crank; the water flows into a channel that leads it out of the place where the exhaustion is made.

  We can make, on a small scale and on the Tour, such a machine that works well. For this, instead of making a simple channel, as we said, we will dig it until there is an axis of eight to ten lines in diameter, if the cylinder is two inches. We will dig squarely, and so that between each of the two channels (because in this case, two are enough not to weaken the room) there is only a partition three lines thick. And these channels will end at both ends in the form shown in fig. G, in f g, h i. We will cover everything with an envelope

  lead envelope in which the screw fits very tightly, and which will be welded on the outside, as we have taught, page 422 et seq., TI; and as one cannot hope that the steps of the propeller join assep just on the interior surface of the lead, so that the water is contained there, one will flow by each channel,. of the hot tar, by tilting the part towards the pipe lead. We will have the satisfaction of seeing the effect that the machine produces on a large scale.

  If the means which we have just indicated of tarring the joints did not succeed completely enough, and if one wanted, in a room intended to enter into the composition of a physics cabinet, to prevent the water from being lost, one could apply in the interior of the channel, or of each of the channels, a thin lead strip, make it take the shape of it, and after having drawn up the edges, bring back a ribbon, also of thin lead, and weld the two sides in their entire length.

  Finally, we can make a thin lead pipe meander through these canals, giving it the creeping shape of the canal, which we would have been content to dig circularly. We will start by welding a straight pipe that is long enough to go from one end of the canal to the other. One end will be plugged with cork or otherwise. We will fill it with fine sand, and by this means we will have the facility to make it take the creeping shape of the canal, without fear that it will bend over, or that it will burst. It will then be emptied, and the two ends will be rubbed with hot mastic, so that water does not seep between the walls of the channel and the pipe. We will then enclose the whole, either in a kind of case made and hollowed out at the hour, or by bringing on the cylinder of the wooden rods properly joined, fixed on the steps of the propeller, with small nails of pin, and then painted in oil.

  We have only dwelled on these small details to provide tools that can be applied to an infinite number of circumstances.

**** SECTION V.

  Doll with snares, return screw.

  The dolls with collars, of which we spoke at the beginning of this Chapter, have a drawback in their use when the part being turned must successively decrease in size: it is necessary to change more.

  Page 116. TURNER'S MANUAL.

  the collars several times and re-center them, which presents difficulties and delays the operation; This is what we tried to remedy by means of the return screw doll, fig. 7 and 8, Pl. 15.

  Body A of this doll resembles that of other collared dolls, and mounts to the workbench in the same way.

  On the length of each of the montans, and in their interior, is made a groove in which flow the two collars B, C. Each of these collars is a boxwood parallelogram, in which a notch of the same shape is made, which extends up to half of its length. At this point we notch the wood so that the two sides meet and form a right angle: these two right and isosceles triangles form by their meeting a square in which the piece is supported while it turns. The lower collar C, fig. 8, carries at its upper end, a nut E. The upper collar B carries on the same side a broken part in which is made a cylindrical hole which embraces the end of the screw F, which we are going to talk about , and makes him call back. These two collars slide very tightly into the grooves made in the interior of the doll's mountings.

  The screw F is divided into two equal parts, and threaded with an equal pitch; but the lower part has two nets, and the upper part has only one.

  The double threaded part passes through the nut placed at the top of the legs of the lower collar. The single step passes through a nut made on the doll's hat. The lower end of the screw is smooth seated, and is embraced by the broken piece placed at the top of the upper collar. The part that goes beyond the bed base ends with a handle G, which is used to turn it.

  It is with the help of this screw that we can reduce or enlarge the square hole, formed by the meeting of the two notches of the collars. In fact, disregarding the lower collar B, if we rotate the screw F, it is clear that the upper collar C will rise or fall by an amount proportional to the height of the single pitch of the screw. While this collar goes up or down, the lower part of the screw which passes through the nut placed at the top of the lower collar C causes this collar to rise or fall by a double amount, since the pitch practiced on this portion of the screw is two-threaded; but by the effect of the screw passing through the bed base, this screw goes up or down in the other direction, by an amount equal to the single pitch of the screw; it follows that with each turn of the screw, the two

  There are few people who have not seen these serpents, the effective length of which is scarcely 5 to 6 inches, and who have the faculty of lying down to 3 or 4 feet, and even many more. This piece, which has been classified as a children's toy, is well worth the attention of Amateurs, since it is one of the most ingenious applications of the Tower in the air. These snakes are usually made of a piece of horn, which is shaped, before cutting, into the shape of a snake, 4 to 5 inches long, without including the tail which is then brought back; thus, it is only a cylinder up to two-thirds of its length, and then gradually tapering off towards the tail. Here is how we do it.

  Choose a piece of horn of sufficient length; and, for the illusion to be greater, we choose it gray, streaked with light and brown. Not every kind of horn is specific to this work. The horn of the oxen in France is too small; and usually the Horn of Ireland is used. Since the oxen are much larger, the horns are longer, and there are full ends of sufficient length. We mount it in a chuck on the Air Lathe, and we give it the shape we just indicated. It is drilled in the center, along its length, with a hole 2 lines thick, starting with the shank, since it is from the side where the head should be that the part is caught in the mandrel. Take this piece off the chuck, and soak it in water for a day or two, until the horn has become a little soft. The part is then returned to the chuck very carefully, since its softness prevents it from being hammered in with a mallet; and one sets it up perfectly so that it turns as round as possible, as one sees it in A, fig.1, PL 16. It is now necessary to make hear the construction, and the play of the Tower represented by the fig.1 .

  B is a Tower tree in the air, similar to any we've seen so far.

  We see at C the column that carries the flywheel, which we have described elsewhere, and which is mounted here in a very special way. An iron shaft E, turned in part of its length, towards the end F, rolls by its two collars between the bearings a, a; the other two are hidden by the pulley G, and cannot be seen in the figure. At the end of that same shaft is a square to which the flywheel enters, which is held in place by a cap nut, as usual. A part of the length of the shaft JG, K, is triangular or square, to receive the pulley I. Finally at the other end K of this shaft estimated to be cylindrical, 7 to 8 inches long, and which turns between two collars which. fit into the frame b of the jib crane h, which must be long enough so that the shaft can be placed in a horizontal position; this is achieved by turning the screw c to the right or to the left, and raising or lowering the frame d. An endless rope passes over pulley G, and that of Tour M; and it is understood that when by means of the pedal one makes the flywheel turn, it drives the shaft E, K, and consequently the pulley G, which is mounted on it, and that the endless rope turns the pulley M, and consequently the shaft of the Lathe, and the part that we want to turn.

  The horn piece A, which will produce the snake, is firmly fixed in the chuck f. Place the carriage holder we have already discussed parallel to the axis of the horn cylinder, and bring the carriage and tool to the end of the cylinder. We remove the crank from above the square of the return screw of the support, and we replace it with a pulley, as we see it at N, and so that it holds there securely, we drill in the center of the return screw. a hole that is then tapped to receive a screw whose head rests against the flat of the pulley, and fixes it on the return screw. As the pulley I slides frictionally on the triangular part of the shaft, it is easy to place it in the direction of the pulley which drives the return screw of the support. An endless rope g, which passes over both pulleys, advances the tool holder from the holder, at the same time as the Lathe shaft and the workpiece rotate; and the tool, advancing imperceptibly, described on the horn cylinder, which he cuts deeply, a torso with very slow steps, which form so many thin leaves, such as we see them, figs. 2, 3 and 4 .

  It is on the more or less speed that we give to the return screw, combined with the more or less size of the pitch of this screw, that depends the more or less thickness that we want to give to the washers or no helix, which form the snake in its entire length. We see, in fact,

  Pl.16

  on inspection of the figure, that if, for example, the puli  e] \ I makes four revolutions while the pulley N makes only one, the onlil will lift four leaves from the propeller while the screw of the support will have advanced one step: the Amateur will therefore combine the report diameters of the upper and lower pulleys, so as to obtain the speeds it will need.

  For this adjustment, you can use a wheel in the air, mounted as usual. The end of the wheel shaft is, as we know, tapped to receive the cap nut, which fixes the pulley to it; it suffices therefore to remove this nut, and to drill at the end of the EK shaft a tapped hole at the same pitch, by means of which it is mounted on the shaft of the wheel, and the whole seems to become one same room. The other end of this shaft E, K, rolls between two bearings, which slide in two grooves made inside the frame that can be seen at the top of the kind of stem shown in the figure, in the same way as the bearings slide in the grooves of a die; and by means of a screw that we see below, we have the ability to lift this tree at each end, and to give a little tension to the endless ropes. We say a little tension; for we must not hope that the bearings can make a long travel in the frame of the gallows: therefore we must take care that the endless ropes are, very nearly, of the suitable length. For this, we will use gut ropes, preferably those of hemp; and by putting a hook at each end, if it lengthens, we are done with screwing the rope a little at each end, and burn off any excess inside the hook.

  We warned that the horn cylinder had to be drilled at its axis with a perfectly straight hole. The tool which will take all the washers must reach up to this hole, as can be seen from figs. 2, 3 and 4 - But as the tool must not cut perpendicular to the axis, but a slightly obliquely, as can be seen in fig. 2, where the leaves form the very flattened cone, and that if the support were inclined with respect to the axis, the tool would not run parallel, and would end by leaving the material, it is the edge itself that must be inclined, as we see separately, fig. 5. The inclination of the tool, once determined, it will be able to walk parallel to the axis, and nevertheless cut obliquely; which is necessary so that each thread of the propeller has more force, and that the serpent, when it unfolds, does not bend, and is not subject to being broken. The shape of the tool, depending on its length, must be part of a

  Pl.16

  circle larger than the circumference of the horn cylinder, and it must start at a time, from the circumference to the center, because it is not possible to repeat it more than once. Although the blade of this tool should be thin, it should not be imagined that it should be infinitely thin. Since the clever part is made up of separate sheets, and which can pull apart to give passage to the tool, it is only the left part that offers some resistance.

  When you have already cut a number of sheets, you should expect to see them hanging on the workbench; and the continual rotation of the part could intertwine the washers and cause them to break: this is how we prevent this accident. A small spindle of some moderately hard wood is passed through the hole in the cylinder, and a small button h is formed towards the end. This pin exceeds, to the right, an inch or so the length of the cylinder; and by this means, all the part already finished has enough to extend to give passage to the tool, without running the risk of being broken.

  If the carriage support return screw does not have enough travel for the tool to travel the entire length of the cylinder, we will have to bring the support tool holder back to the end of the carriage, by lowering the screw. reminder, and shift the support to the left, until the tool is exactly at the point where we stopped, and we will continue, as we did, until the snake is finished . We will not go all the way, but only against the mandrel, as far as the support frame will allow. As the head of the return screw, on which the pulley is mounted, is quite short, you cannot advance the support to the left, although by bringing the tool holder to the right of the carriage holder, without the end of the snake, and especially the peg which one put there, does not touch the pulley, and even that this pulley does not interfere with the course of the tool. Here is a simple way you can remedy this drawback. The pulley will be mounted in the middle of a steel shaft 3 to 4 inches long, on a square reserved there. One end of this shaft will fit just over the square of the head of the return screw; and as the pulling of the endless rope would harm the solidity of the pulley, and its shaft should not bewill not turn along the axis of the return screw, the other end of the shaft will be drilled with a shallow hole to receive the tip of a tailstock placed behind the pulley, and to the right of the artist . When the propeller is completely finished, we will remove the part from above the Lathe, and we will put it through the other end in a fen-

  split, to give the head the shape it should have, and which has been made as sensitive as possible by fig. G, which represents the partially deployed serpent. This snake can be grasped in the mandrel, by the part which remains cylindrical, between a and b, fiig. 6.

  So that we do not see the hole that begins with the tail, we will turn a small button that we will stick to the end, and which should go decreasing like the tail, and be finished in the round. We will split the head to form the mouth, and we will use a fine-toothed saw for this. We will repair everything cleanly with fine skins, and of suitable shape. We can stick a small piece of red cloth in this slit, to imitate the tongue; although it is not the color of a serpent's tongue, custom has prevailed to make them that color.

  Two holes will be drilled to glue two enamel eyes; and to succeed, we will make the hemispherical hole to glue the two small globes to it. We could drill the hole further and insert two pieces of ivory painted black, which had the spherical shape only in front, and which from behind were terminated by a tail which would hold more firmly; but the latter are less close to nature than the enamel ones.

  If the propeller's pitches are a little thin, and the cylinder on which we have operated is 5 to 6 inches long, this snake will be able to lie down, holding it suspended, up to 4 or 5 feet, and the a variety of colors, the horn of which is marbled, will produce a very agreeable effect. Since it can always go back to the original length of the cylinder, we will turn a case and give it roughly the length that the cylinder had, and we will thus keep the snake without fear of breaking it.

  As it is possible that an Amateur does not have a cart support, we are going to give another way of making the same snake with a simple Tower in the air, and a support that we can easily make oneself. .

  Fig. 7, same board, shows a Tour in ordinary air, seen from behind the workbench, so that the position of the tool can be better understood. A is a part of the tree that passes between the collars of the front doll, the other being supposedly hidden. We see the horn cylinder B in its mandrel C, which can be split. This cylinder is drilled like the previous one, along its axis; but instead of a wooden spindle, a very narrow iron spindle D is inserted into it, the length of which exceeds twice that of the cylinder, and tapped throughout its exterior part. The size of this

  Pl.16

  spindle can be about two lines, and the pitch of the screw is equal to the thickness you want to give to the washers on the propeller. It passes through a doll with collars, as we have described it, and whose collars are tapped at the same pitch as the screw. The Tour goes by means of a wheel, either above or below the workbench. We lower the stop key, and we feel that the shaft, turning in a continuous movement, is called towards the right of the worker, who is the left of the reader, by the screw spindle Z), which advances very slowly. As the tool, while cutting the material, opposes a rather great resistance, and believed the rock, by attracting the snake, could make it leave the mandrel, it is necessary that this spindle passes through the mandrel, and comes to be screwed in a nut of copper fixed in the inside of the nut by which the mandrel mounts to the nose of the shaft. A support E, which has no revolving chair, but only a post assembled in the sole, dovetail or otherwise, provided it is very strong, carries the tool F; but so that this tool is retained invariably and securely, one attaches with good screws on the top of the support a slide in which the tool is fixed by means of two pressure screws a, a. This tool is made like the one on the carriage support, fi g. i, except that it is fitted as seen, which is not, however, very necessary. We could, to an ordinary support, fix a wedge of suitable height, and above which was a slide, as we have just said.

  We can easily see that the screw spindle, calling the cylinder, as well as the Lathe, which has the ability to advance between the bearings, makes the tool, which remains motionless, travel the entire length of the horn cylinder, and that the snake is formed with the greatest ease. Tool F has its cutting edge like the previous one; and except for the mechanics, it's absolutely the same operation.

  RiThe necks of the tree should, as far as possible, be long enough to accommodate all the travel required by the snake. The tree that is used for the torso works well in this circumstance.

  If, however, we only had an ordinary shaft, we could still take advantage of it by moving it back each time, so that the base touched the headstock, and by returning the support and the tool to the right place. where we left off. We will take all suitable precautions so that we do not notice the recovery, by moving the tree back and forth, to judge whether we are continuing the started line: which presents enough, great difficulties.

  An Amateur distinguished by his knowledge in the Arts, and particularly in the Tour, assured us that he had seen these snakes in Germany by a method infinitely simpler than the two preceding ones. The simplicity of this method and the ease of trying it out have determined us to present it to our Readers. Fig. 8 represents an ordinary crankshaft, of wood or iron, in the box of which enters a kind of mandrel whose rod is square. The head A is split along its length, and has a sufficient range to embrace the cylinder of horn which is pierced, on the side of the snake's tail, with a hole of two and a half lines or so, as above. An iron spindle is inserted into this hole, as in fig. i, and whose function is to prevent the washers from twisting and breaking.

  A wooden wedge C, which can be fixed on a doll with glasses, or in a vice, carries a kind of steel horseshoe D, fixed on the wedge, by means of three wood screws. This horseshoe is made of sheet steel, with a good line of thickness, split along its length, up to the circular hole shown in fig. 9. The center hole is smooth, its edges are a little rounded, so that the spindle enters it gently. The right side has a horseshoe, which forms a very sharp angle with the other, is not on the same plane as it, but comes just a little forward, bending upwards, while the side b is applied exactly on the plane of the wedge: thus the two sides of this very acute opening make, with respect to their planes, the same angle as that which is seen in fig. 9. Side a is sharpened in the shape of a knife, by the meeting of two bevels, and must cut perfectly. It is the inclination of one of the sides a of this horseshoe, relative to the other b, that gives the obliqueness that we notice in the washers, figs. 2, 3 and 4.

  We put the spindle in the hole, pressing against the handle E of the crankshaft, and turning from left to right, we force the horn to be cut by the edge a, and the more or less spacing on both sides ô, a, near the hole, determine the thickness of the washers. We believe that we have said enough about this machine that it can be tried out inexpensively and very easily. When the body is finished, we will make the head and the tail in the way we indicated above.

** CHAPTER V. Balls, Polyhedra, Stars.
*** SECTION ONE. Machine to make the Balls.

  All the pieces that we are going to deal with in this chapter can only be performed on a perfectly regular ball or sphere.

  We saw in the first Volume how to make a simple ball on the Tour in the air, and we know how difficult this operation presents: these difficulties are so great that we can say that it is almost impossible to overcome them. overcome; the workmen themselves, who do it continually, like the tablet-makers, very rarely succeed. We can be convinced of this, by checking several billiard balls with the caliber we will discuss at the end of this section, and we will see that there is not one exactly round.

  These considerations determined to seek a means of executing a ball by a continuous movement, and without having to loter of the mandrel and to put it back again and again; and this has been achieved by means of the instrument which we are about to describe, with which moreover one is relieved of the continual attention which it takes to follow the line of the equator; which is not the least of the difficulties one has in operating in the ordinary way.

  This instrument consists of a support of a particular shape, shown in fig. i and 2, PI. 17. U is mounted on a base, of wood A, terminated by a tenon B y which must fit very closely into the groove of the workbench. In the center of the lower part of this tenon is made a hole, in which enters a bolt or Roman screw similar to those which fix them. Tour dolls on the table

  This base carries a circular copper plate, D, fig. i, and seen flat, fig. 3, inlaid on the base to which it is fixed by four wood screws, and of which it comes flush with the surface: three or four lines from the circumference is a staff a, of which we will see the 'use. The center has a truncated cone of about eight lines, and cast in the same pattern, followed by a hexagon, and terminated in a small tapped portion. This cone, which is more distinctly seen at b, on Section ^ g. 4, is absolutely similar to the one with the movable noses of the eccentric and the oval.

  A second F is placed on this first plate, fig. i and 2, and seen flat, fi.g. 4, drilled in its center with a circular hole a. Below this plate, and near its circumference, is a bezel b, which comes just within the reach of the lower plate and by means of which the upper plate can rotate on the lower plate which remains stationary. The perfect fit of these two pieces, one on top of the other, is of the utmost importance; because that is where the accuracy of the machine largely depends.

  The upper plate has on its field a rounded groove in a portion of a circle, on which are made inclined teeth, where the pitches of a worm O, fig. 1, 2 and 12 mesh. This screw is fixed on the wooden base by an iron screed, in which it is held by two collars, which do not allow it to move forward or backward. Figs. 13 and 14 show the development of these two pieces on a double scale. A, is the chappe seen on its thickness.

  This plate is retained on the other by an adjustment similar to that of the movable noses of the oval and the eccentric, and which gives it the ability to rotate on its center. This adjustment consists of a conical part pierced with a hexagonal hole, as seen in c c, fig. 4 - A nut d d, same figure, is used to fix the whole.

  Fig. 5 represents the section of the upper plate: we see at b the hole which receives the cone and the other parts just mentioned: c, c indicates the bezel; e ?, c ?, the groove carrying the gear teeth; e, e is a circular facelift made to make the room elegant.
  It is on this second plate that the tool holder G, G, fig. 1 and 2, and seen separately, is placed, ^ ". 6 and 7: its base has a parallelogram, the small sides a, a, of which are rounded to the circumference of the circle. The long sides by ô, form two inclined planes, by means of which the part adjusts to a dovetail and slides between two slides H, H, fig. 1, and 2, fixed on the plate by four screws similar to the one fig. g.

Pl.17

  Fig.8 shows one of these slides seen flat in A, and over its thickness in B; this tool holder is moved between the two slides by means of a return screw K, fig. r, and viewed in its entire length, fig. io. This screw adjusts like the one that moves the eccentric slide; this is why we will not stop at describing this adjustment, which we will detail elsewhere.

  A notch m is made at the top of the tool holder, fig. i, intended to receive the tool, which is held there by the two screws n, n. We can see the shape and position of this tool.  in fig. 11, representing a geometric plane of the tool holder. This plan has been drawn on a scale double that of the other figures, to indicate more clearly the position to be given to the tool, and which can only be seen imperfectly on the geometrical view, fig. 12.

  Fig. 16 shows the tool seen flat: this tool is nothing more than a kind of barley grain, the figure of which sufficiently indicates the shape.

  Fig. 17 is a key whose end is square and is used to move the return screw, the head of which has a hole of the same shape.

  We see in fig.12 in small a, a division drawn on the slide, and an index on the tool holder. We will make its use known by teaching how to work with this instrument.

  We will begin by placing in a mandrel a cylinder of some good wood, and we will reduce it to the suitable diameter, which should be a little larger than that of the ball we want to make. We will then rough this cylinder with a gouge, and we will give it a shape approaching that of a sphere supported on a circular base, as seen in fig. 1. This base is used to hold the ball in the chuck during the operation, and its upper surface will be shaped into an inclined plane, to facilitate the passage of the tool.

  After this preliminary work, we will place the instrument on the workbench, making the tenon enter the groove, and we will run the tool holder, using the return screw, until the index has traveled on the division, from point o, a space equal to the radius of the ball, in the state in which it is. Then we will slide the tenon of the base in the groove of the workbench until the tip of the tool, which must be right at the height of the center of the Lathe, touches the ball at a quarter of its circumference. , from one of the two poles which are in the axis of the Tour. Fig-1 shows the tool in this position.

  As the diameter of a ball roughed out simply with a gouge does not

Pl.17

  can be taken very exactly, it may happen that when the instrument is approached to the ball, the tip of the tool protrudes, we do not reach the indicated point; then we will move the return screw in one direction or in a
  other, until this point comes flush with the ball at this point: we say flush; for, particularly when beginning to work, it is necessary to take very little wood at a time, on account of the roughness which still covers the surface of the blank. After all these precautions, the instrument will be fixed by the bolt that goes under the workbench.

  Everything being thus arranged, we will set the Lathe in motion using the wheel placed above or below the workbench, and at the same time we will turn the worm screw crank to the left, until that the tool has reached the pole opposite to the point at which the ball holds at its base; which is easy to recognize, because the tool, once at this point, stops cutting into the wood. Then turn the crank in the other direction, until the tool has reached the opposite pole, and take care, when approaching this pole, to detach the ball from its base. Be careful to reserve enough wood for it to be securely held there, and a little will be removed with each pass of the tool.

  Could it happen that, if we had to move a rather considerable mass of wood to the side of the base, the tool would experience sufficient resistance? strong to reject it on the opposite side, which would undoubtedly alter the perfect sphericity of the ball. That’s why, while teaching how to rough the ball with a gouge, we recommended giving the base the shape of an inclined plane. It will be good at this time to further reduce this mass of wood with a barley grain, which will be supported on the tool holder as on an ordinary support; because, once the instrument is in place, it is important not to disturb anything.

  With each pass of the tool, we will take care to make it advance insensibly using the return screw, until the index has reached the division of the slide, at the point which indicates the radius to be have the ball. In this state we will make two or three more passes with the tool, without touching the return screw, and always approaching more and more the point by which the ball is still held; these passes finish to give it the polish, so that it only remains to detach it at the last. If we have operated correctly, and if the tool cuts perfectly, the surface of the ball will come out smoothly, and we cannot even notice the two points that served as poles during the operation. We must be careful not to use the polishing paper, or any other means, to

---
Page 128 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.17
  give it more brilkint. The ball is completely finished when the tool detaches it from its base, and all the meansens that we would then use could only alter its regularity.

  We can be convinced of the goodness of the instrument which we have just described, and of the accuracy of its results, by checking the ball in a caliber fig. 18. This gauge is a very thin plate, of copper or of wood, in which one drills with the lathe, and with the greatest care, a circular hole of the exact diameter of the ball, and the interior edges of which are thinned in the form of a bevel. . You will pass the ball through all your senses, and if you have operated well, it will pass each time with equal ease; which demonstrates its perfect sphericity.

  But to arrive at this point of perfection, it is necessary to observe some essential conditions.

  The first is that the tip of the tool is placed exactly at the height of the center of the Lathe. To be sure, we will approach this point vis-à-vis the pole of the rough ball, and if the point is too high or too low, we will easily notice it, because it will trace a small circle on the material, which it will not reach inside. If it is too high, the thickness of the tool will be reduced; if it is too low, it will be propped up with a map, a piece of paper or some other way; but these latter means do not appear to us to be precise enough for an operation which requires the greatest precision, and we advise amateurs to obtain a thicker tool instead.

  Another essential condition is that the center on which the instrument moves is on an elevated perpendicular from the middle of the groove of the workbench, and which therefore cuts, at right angles, the extension of the axis of the Lathe. .

  Finally, the upper and lower surfaces of the two shelves, and those of the wooden base, both on the side that carries the first shelf, and on the side through which it touches the workbench, must be perfectly parallel between
  they.

  The instrument meeting all these conditions, and the point of the tool being placed, by means of the division of the slide, at the radius of the ball, it is easy to see that the circle resulting from the revolution of the ball will cut at angles. right the semicircle described by the point of the tool, and that both having the same center and the same diameter, the ball obtained by these two combined movements cannot fail to be perfectly spherical.

Page 129 CHAP. V. Sect. I. Machine to make the balls.

  We said at the beginning of this article, that we must chuck the cylinder in which we want to take the ball. We could also mount the cylinder itself on the nose of the Tour, by making a nut at its end, as seen in fig. But these means, which are good when the wood we use is not of great price, would become too expensive, if we were working on precious wood or on ivory; and here is the one to use in this case.

  The surface of the mandrel, and that of the end of the cylinder of wood or ivory, the length of which must not exceed more than one line at most the diameter of the ball, should be drawn up perfectly and with the greatest care. These two surfaces will be glued one on top of the other, after having practiced, with the help of a barley grain, a few circular lines which facilitate the effect of the glue. When the glue is completely dry, we will operate as usual, and as if everything were in one piece.

  We have had one of these instruments performed before our eyes, and with proper care; and by using it with the precautions which we have detailed, we obtained balls whose perfection leaves nothing to be desired. We will arrange to have them made for Amateurs who wish to obtain similar ones; but it is essential that we calculate just the width of the groove of their workbench, and the distance from the center of their lathe to the surface of the workbench. This is why we urge them to include a planchette cut on model 19 with their request.

  The lower part A must fit very closely into the groove of the workbench, and the shoulders B B must rest at all their points on the surface of the workbench, which must be perfectly upright; which it will be good to make sure, for the slightest inequality would make the use of our instrument very difficult. Finally, we will mark on this board the point of the center of the Lathe, by placing it by its tenon in the groove of the workbench, and by approaching it with a point mandrel, mounted for this purpose on the nose of the workbench. 'tree. In the absence of a point mandrel, we will use a point of boxwood or other hard wood, as we have taught in other circumstances.

  We believe we should place at the end of this article the description of a mandrel, the use of which is infinitely preferable to the hollowed-out mandrel which we used in our first Volume, in the article of polyhedra. The one of which we are going to speak is, in truth, more composed; but we obtain by its means of the resresults are much more accurate, and its use is essential for most of the operations described in this chapter.

  Special mandrel for all Polyhedra.

  We will begin by making a mandrel fig. 21 and 22, PL ig, hollowed out to the diameter of the ball, like the one we indicated in our first Aolume, pag-. 32 1. A smooth bearing a, similar to the throat of a snuffbox, will be formed on the outside and at the edge of the mandrel. On the body of this mandrel, between the bearing surface and the base, we will make a screw b of mediocre size; we will then make on another mandrel a cover c, hollowed out in a half-ball, to the diameter of the one we want to work; we will make a staff like that of the lid of a snuffbox, which fits just over the one we have made with the mandrel, so that when the lid is placed on the mandrel, there is a hollow capable of containing the can with a little strength. This cover will be detached, and it will be completed on the mandrel, to which it must be fixed by means of the heel ring d, which screws onto the body of the mandrel; by tightening this ring, we bring together the two parts of the mandrel, where the sphere is placed, which is thus held there securely and without being able to experience the slightest disturbance. Shorten the chuck cover around it until you reach with the tool the spherical cap hollowed out in its interior; and we will continue until the opening has a larger diameter than the faces on either side of the polyhedron.

  We will enclose the ball in this hollow, where it will be retained by the cover, which we will tighten by screwing the ring tight enough. The boule must be placed so that the point that you have marked on the face you want to perform is perfectly in the center.

  We see that the mandrel in which the part is contained is of the greatest convenience, in that it suffices to loosen a little 1 ring which holds the cover to turn the ball in the direction which is needed, without it. always stops going round.

*** SECTION II Mathematical principles for the plotting of the five regular Polyhedra, and the Stars on the surface of the sphere.

  In the first edition of this work we referred, for the division of the sphere, to the Treaties of Geometry. Several people who have represented to us that the authors, instead of giving direct and precise methods to achieve this operation, have enveloped it in principles which, although simple in themselves, involve some difficulty in their application, we have determined to put before the public's eyes a collection of problems relating to art, either to construct the five regular polyhedra, or to arrange on the surface of the ball a number of points corresponding to the nature of the division that one proposes to perform.

  We will go into various other details suitable to interest and guide amateurs.

  Educated readers will find it easy to understand us. As for those who have no tincture of the mathematical sciences, our work will not be useless to them; and if the thread of our solutions escapes their understanding, they will be compensated by the advantage of being able to achieve the goal they want to achieve, by mechanically practicing the processes we teach them.

**** OBSERVATION.

  Modern geometers divide the circle into 40o parts or grades; each degree = 0.01 of the quadrans taken as unit. Every minute = 0.01 of a degree, or 0.0001 of a quadrans: every second = 0.01 of a minute, or 0.000001 of a quarter circle.

  Whether one has to express ninety-seven degrees, seventy-two minutes ninety-seven seconds, one can indifferently write 97 °, 72 ', 97 ",; 1 or 0.977297.

  We will conform in our calculations to this new system, in all respects preferable to the old one. However, next to each centesimal result, we will take the precaution of indicating, between two parentheses, its sexagesimal value.

---
Page 132 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.18

  And, as on a small volume ball, a minute is almost imperceptible, we will only count the seconds as long as they add up to at least 0.5.

**** DEFINITIONS.
***** From the Sphere.

  The sphere is a solid body, bounded by a single surface, all the points of which are equally distant from an interior point, which is given the name of Center.

  The axis or diameter is a line that goes through the center, and ends at the surface.

  The poles are two points located at the ends of the axis.

  You can draw large and small circles on the surface of a sphere.

  Large circles are those whose planes meet the center of the sphere.

  Small circles are those whose planes pass next to the center. The equator is a large circle perpendicular to the axis. All points of its circumference are away from the poles by 100 ° (90 °), or a quadrans.

  Parallels are small circles parallel to the equator.

***** Polyhedra.

  A solid terminated by plane polygons is called a polyhedron.

  We distinguish, in a polyhedron, plane surfaces, solid angles, formed by the assortment of several plane angles.

  The existence of a solid angle, or an angloid, depends on two conditions: 1 °. the competition of at least three plane angles; 2 0. of the measurement of these angles, which must be substantially less than 400 ° (360 °).

  It is impossible to compose a polyhedron with less than four plane polygons.

  Not all polygons are equally suitable for forming a polyhedron. There are only a very few that can be used, especially in the construction of regular polyhedra.

  By regular polyhedra, we mean those in the structure of which

---
Page 133 CHAP. V. Sect. II. Mathematical principles for plotting, etc.
Pl.18

  only equal regular polygons are entered, and all of the angloids are equal to each other.

  There are five of them:

  Each angle of an equilateral triangle having only 0.6666 (60 °), we can, by arranging around the same point three, four and up to five of these angles, obtain an angloid. In neither of these cases, their sum goes to 400 ° or 4 quadrans.

  These three sets produce the tetrahedron, the octahedron, and the icosahedron.

  Three right angles only give 300 ° (270 °). They can generate a solid angle. It is from their union that the hexahedron, vulgarly the cube, is born.

  Three angles of pentagons give only 360 ° (324 °), and are, therefore, able to compose an angloid. Assemble twelve of these polygons, you will have a dodecahedron.

  It is on considerations drawn from the construction of regular polyhedra that all the divisions of the sphere are based. They will therefore be the only ones we will deal with.

**** Division of the Ball into four.

  Circumvent a spherical surface around a tetrahedron. The ends of the solid angles, leaning on this surface, will print on it four points which, joined by six arcs of a great circle, will be placed at the vertices of four equilateral triangles, all the sides of which will be equal.

  It suffices to calculate 1 any one of these sides. By this evaluation the respective distances of all the points, and the order of their distribution will be fully determined.


***** SOLUTION.

  Let tt be the half-circumference; and let ^ /, B, C be the angles of one of these triangles; a, b, c, the opposite sides. The angle at the pole = 2/3 π = A = B = C; a = b = c.

  Let A ', B', C 'be the supplements of A, B, C; and a ', b', c 'those of a, b, c.

  To solve these cases, we have proposed the formula

Pl.18.
FIXME
Sin. ½ a '= R. sin. o, 3333.

  (35 °, 16 '), value which reported in its fundamental formula, reduces it to sin. ½ a '= 0.3919.

  This is where we get sin. at = 0.7837. (70 °, 32 '.) supplement of I q, 2163 (109 °, 28').

  By means of this solution, we are able to divide the sphere into four.

  Suppose we have carefully turned a ball, we will mark its poles and its equator, which we will divide into three. Through each point, we will pass, on the Tour, using a pencil, a semi-circumference of a large circle, which will join the two poles without going beyond them.

  This preparation completed, we will take the diameter of the sphere very exactly, using a compass with curved legs, or, which is much more convenient, a caliber with movable and very parallel branches.

  Let E C, fig. 1, be this diameter extended on a plain cardboard or a very strong paper: from the middle O, we lead by the two ends E, C, the circumference A B C D E. We will continue at our discretion E C; and on its extension, we will measure a line O f, equal in length, on a decimal scale of an average size; for example, to one of those that are commonly engraved on the brackets of Mathematics cases, and on f we will drop the perpendicular g f.

  We will then consult a table of sines, and tangents, in which we will observe that the natural tangent of 0.2163 (19 ° - 28 '.) Excess of 1 q, 21 63 (109 °. 28') over 100 ° ( 90 °), contains FIXME ??? of the radius. But because the division of ordinary scales is only extended to 1.000, the last four digits of the numerator and denominator will be removed. The fraction - FIXME ??? indicates that we should take 353 parts of the scale we have adopted, which we will carry from f to g. The BOD angle

Pl.18

  between the secant O g and the radius O D will be 100 ° + 0.2163 = 1q, 2163 (100 ° 28 ').

  It is no longer a question of transporting B CD on the three semi-circumferences which have been established in advance for this purpose: an operation which is all the more simple as each of these semi-circles being divided into two by the equator, it only remains to complete three of the quadrans located in the same hemisphere, by adding to them o, 2 i 63: which will be done with an ordinary compass, and with an opening equal to the chord of the arc B C. In this way we will have three distant points, either between them or from the pole furthest from 1q, 2163 (109 ° 28 '), and the ball will be divided into four.

**** Construction of the tetrahedron.

  The same result can be achieved by another route. This second solution is based on the following propositions.

  1 °. The figure center of an equilateral triangle is one third of its height: that of a tetrahedron is one quarter.

  2 °. The line leading through the apex of one of the angloids, and the figure center of a tetrahedron, passes through the figure center of the base opposite that vertex.

  These principles set, let ABCDEFG fig.2 be any circle; AD, CE, two diameters which intersect at right angles: we will do Og = ⅓R = ⅓OA, and we will take the parallel B F to the diameter CE; having taken gc = ½R = ½OF, we will draw BD, Dc, and BDc will be the profile of a tetrahedron.

  This triangle represents the surface that would be discovered by a cutting plane which, while following one of the edges of the tetrahedron, would slide along the perpendicular laid on the middle of the base of the triangle opposite that edge.

  Let us establish the legitimacy of this construction, and prove that the arc BD - 1q, 2163 (109 °. 28 '). DC = 100 ° (90 0.) The sine of the angle BOQ = Og = ⅓ R = 3333333. The closest one in the natural sine tables is 3332584 which answers 0.2163 (19 ° 28 '). So DC + CB = 100 ° + 0.2163 = 1q, 2163 (109 ° 28 ').

  It is essential that people who want to cut a polyhedron know exactly the specific sections of the solid that they are intending to construct.; otherwise we would be exposed to perilous gropings, and most often we would risk going beyond the limits within which we must shut ourselves up.

  Geometry cuts the knot of this difficulty; to the advantage of obtaining correct and expeditious methods for operating all the divisions of which the sphere is susceptible, it joins that of showing the diameter of the segments which must be separated from the ball, to transform it into a polyhedron. In fig. 2, this diameter is indicated by the chord BF, or its equal DG. Let’s explain in a few words the proper use to be made of this line, and the advantage that can be drawn from it.

  Let ABCDEF be the perimeter of a proposed globe: with a compass opening equal to the chord of the arc AB, and around the four points of division making the functions of centers, we will draw four circles. Their circumferences will be the confines of the sections analogous to the tetrahedron.

  When the faces of the polyhedron are shaped step by step, among the segments which the chisel detaches, there is only the first whose base remains intact, the others are disfigured by more or less deep breaches and multiplied, according to the nature of the polyhedron we are working on. For the avoidance of doubt, we caution that we disregard these indentations, and that we treat each segment as if there is no alteration.

  Once we have built the plane of a tetrahedron, we can think of it as a kind of formula applicable to an infinity of different spheres. The Theory of proportional lines generalizes this construction.

  Let's clarify this with an example:

  In the interior of fig. 2, and of a radius Od, which we will assume given, describe abdef concentrically: lead OR, OD, OF, OG. Join the four meeting points b, d, e, f by the strings bd, df, be y because of Ob = Od = Oe = Of, of Bb = Dd = Fe = Gf, the sides OB, OD, OF, OG of triangles DOB, DOG, BOF will be cut proportionally by bd, df, be, which will take situations parallel to BD, DG, BF ', and a second triangle b of' will be born before your eyes, obviously similar to B Dc.


  N. B. What we say about the tetrahedron does not suit it exclusively, and belongs to all regular polyhedra.

  We recommend as a useful precaution, not to depart from the ABCDEF framework, not that the operation was geometrically good; but in practice, it would be vicious and subject to imperfections whose

  intelligent readers will easily grasp the reason. Whenever possible, it is necessary to avoid going from small to large, and on the contrary to reduce from large to small. It is according to this principle that the mechanics conceived the idea of ​​the platform on which they divide the wheels of watches and clocks, the grapliometers, sextans, octans, and all the instruments intended for uses which require extreme precision.

**** Division into six.

  Divide the equator into four equal parts. Each point will be distant from that which precedes or follows it, and of one and the other pole, of a quadran. This division is not a problem.

**** Construction of the hexahedron.

  Suppose a hexahedron ADfe, BCgh, fig. 3, inscribed in a spherical surface produced by the movement of the circumference ABICDL, around its axis IL.

  If, by thought, you introduce a cutting plane into this device, so that it passes through the two diagonals A 'C' B 'D', fig. 4, it is clear that you will only have the circle left. A 'B'I'C'D'L' and the parallelogram A 'B' C 'D'.

  A'D '= B C is the diameter of the six sections which would give rise to a cube, if they were made to a splaere whose radius would be equal to OB'. ad and oc are elements of the same kind, proportional to another sphere which would have Ob for radius.

**** Eight division.

  Through the equator and the two poles of the ball, drive two large circles that intersect at right angles. You will thus form eight equilateral spherical triangles. Write as many circles there, their centers will be the points of your division.

**** Construction of the octahedron.

  In the circle ABDC, fig. 5, write the square abdc. Through the center O lead AD parallel to ab or cd, and BC perpendicular to AD. Ask a ruleboth on the end D of O D and on the point of intersection of the two lines O B, ab, pull Dux: this chord or its equal Auy will be the diameters of the constituent sections of the octahedron.

  The solid angles of this polyhedron belong to the family of quadrangular pyramids, composed with four equilateral triangles, and which have a square as base.

  ODu is the angle that the apothems of the component faces make with the axis of each angloid; let's try to determine it.

  Let d De, fig. 6, be one of the sides reversed on the same plane as the base abdc, and let us shorten, uDc = A, cu = a, ucD = B, uD = b, cOu = A ', Ocu = B , Where = b '.

  The relation of Du to Ou is deduced from these two analogies;

  Formula identical with that of which we have concluded the additional elements of the division into four, and which, direct in the present case, gives the same value 0.3919 (35 ° 16 '). So by taking two arcs Dby, Aax of 0.3919 x 2 = 0.7837 (70 ° 32 '), because the angle ODu has its vertex at the circumference, and pressing on their ends x, y the two strings Dux, Auy conducted from points A and I), we will immediately construct the plane of an octahedron.

**** Division into twelve.

  Examine attentively an icosahedron, you will observe among its elements, twelve solid angles which, if you register the polyhedron in a sphere, will produce by the contact of their vertices with the circumscribed surface, twelve points whose arrangement will offer you a faithful type of its division .

  Join them by arcs of a great circle, and you will form twenty equilateral spherical triangles, perfectly equal, whose sides will express in degrees and parts of degrees, the respective distances of your twelve points.

  Let a, ô, c, be these sides, A, B, C, the angles which are opposite to them.

  The angle at the pole = ⅖π = A = B = C. a = b = c.

  Nothing could be easier than to adapt this solution to the stated division. Drive through the two poles of the sphere five circumferences which form between them angles of 0.80 (72 0). Attach to each half-circumference a sign that can help you distinguish it if necessary. For example, if you designate which one you deem appropriate to watch as the first, by 1, the next nine will be 2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10. Firm the point of an ordinary compass on one of the poles, and a

opening that embraces 0.7048 / 2 = 0.3534 (31 ° 43 '), draw a first parallel to the equator.

  Outside and around this small circle, store five more that are flush with it without Fentanaer. To describe them, you will keep your original compass opening, and successively take position on 1. 3. 5. 7. 9.

  Do the same on the second hemisphere. But after having established your second parallel, to deploy your last five circumferences, you will park on 2. 4. 6. 8. 10. By this process, you will engage the ball under twelve circles, which will touch each other step by step without intersecting, and whose centers will be distributed in the same way as the vertices of the angloids of an icosahedron.

  Otherwise, fix one of the branches of your compass on one of the poles A or B. Suppose on A. Open the instrument, and put on the other leg, at a distance of 0.3524 (31 ° 43 '), estimated approximately. Around this turn the first one, the point of which you will stop at a. Lift in turn the end which rests on 1, and present it, without disturbing the one which you placed on a, to the pole B. If it does not fall there precisely, start again, by tightening or widening the opening of the compass, until the three paths traversed obliquely are equal. When you will have fulfilled this condition, by the two points indicating your stations on 1 and on 2, lead two parallels. Keep on one only the intersections provided by the half-circumferences 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. Do not let sur other than intermediate intersections 2. 4. 6. 8. 10: and the ball will be further divided into twelve.

**** Construction of the dodecahedron.

  Let OE fig. 7 be the radius of a sphere stripped of the segments corresponding to the twelve circles used in the first of the two preceding methods, and BD the chord of an arc of o, 7048 (63 ° 26 '). Substitute for these segments twelve regular pentagons built on the model of abc def, fig. 8, which is circumscribed on a circumference aghikl whose diameter ai = BD (fig. 7), since the area of ​​each superimposed circle, and the plane on which you will have laid it will be of the same dimension, these two elements will agree exactly. By an effect of this coincidence, the contiguous sides of the pentagonal polygons will naturally relate

 , and will unite intimately. The protruding angles will fill the void of the re-entrant angles without interstices; and the globe thus coated will eventually acquire the form of a dodecahedron.

  Imitate the mechanism of this composition. In this view you will do Bq fig. q, - ai (fig. 8) on point q, drive Imnyp zqk concentrically: open a compass so that one of its points sits on B, and the other on q. Bring it to m, without moving its binoculars, and pull B m.

  If after having assembled twelve pentagons equal to ab cdef, fig. 8, you inscribe in a spherical surface the polyhedron which will result from this arrangement, its external circumference Imnyp zqk, fig. 7, will be that of the circumscribed envelope, Bq and Bm extended in n and in p, will be the diameters of the organic sections of the inscribed solid.

  Assuming that the inner circle A BD C is representative of a given ball, the above construction would be somewhat out of the question. But by means of the rays Or, Os, Ot, Ou, and the strings rt, su led by the intersections r s tu, we will enter there easily.

  Each solid angle of a dodecahedron is the apex of a triangular pyramid, formed by three plane angles of 1q, 20 (108 °) matched around the same point, and mounted on an equilateral triangle.

  O q n is the angle that the apothems of the component faces make with the axis of the angloids.

  l8 'there remains ny + zq, = 2 ny = ny p = 0.1260 (11 °, 20').

  So if from the ends of an axis of 0.1260 (n °, 20 ') we draw two strings which cross, and detach by intersecting, two other arcs of o, 83 o 8 (74 ° ■ 460 we will have the plane of a dodecahedron.

**** Division into twenty.

  First divide the surface of your ball into twelve. Join your division points by arcs of a great circle. You will form twenty equilateral spherical triangles. Write as many circles there. Their centers will be the indices of the division into twenty.

**** Construction of the icosahedron.

  Let AB C D EFG, fig. 9, be the generating circle of a sphere destined to become an icosahedron, DG the chord of an arc of 0.7048 X2 (63 °. 26 '
  x 2) = 1q, 4097 (126 °. 52 ').

  Each solid angle of this polyhedron is the apex of a pyramid formed by five equilateral triangles, and which has a regular pentagon as its base.

  AFC is the angle that the apothems of these triangles make with the axes of the angloids. By the nature of the elements which enter into the composition of these pyramids, A = 0.3333 (30 °) B = 0.6666 (6o °), A = 0.40 (36 °), B '= 0.60 ( 54 °), and ....

  0.8307 (74 °. 46 ') is the measure of CL h EfF, which sets the length of the chord of this arc.

  With regard to BuE, in order to fix with respect to its equal CuF, its situation on the semi-circumference ABi Dk EfF, draw the perpendiculars Oi, Of, and through the point u lead the radius O k which will divide the l 'in two angle i O f

  gub = i q, 5354 (i 38 °, 1î '): this is what we will verify below.

  Because O gu, O bu are rectangles, gOb extra gub = 0.4646 (41 °, 49 ') and its half kOf = 0.2323. (20 °, 54 ', 30 ").

  But CDkEf = ½ 0.837 (½ 74 °. 46 ') = 0.41535 (37 ° .23'): And CDk = CDkEf - kEf = 0.415350 —0.2323 = 0.18350 (16 ° 0.28 '28 " Doubling, we have 2.CDk '= CDkE = 0.3661 (32 °, 57').

  So if from the ends of an arc of o, 366 i (32 °, 57 ') we lead two ropes which intersect, and carry two portions of circumference of 0.8307 (74 °, 46') each, we will construct very simply the plane of an icosahedron.

**** From the inclination of the adjacent faces of regular polyhedra.


  It is sometimes necessary to know the inclination of the adjacent faces of regular polyhedra. The use we have made of the gub angle provides us with a first proof of this truth, which we will subsequently have the opportunity to be convinced more fully.

  We can solve this problem geometrically or trigonometrically.


***** Trigornometric solution.


  Take five angles, trihedrons, one from each polyhedron, and place the vertices of these angloids in the center of a sphere. Their planes, crossing its surface, will contain five spherical triangles whose sides a, b, c will be known, and you will have to calculate the angle A opposite to the side a, which you will determine by the usual formula.

  It has undoubtedly been observed that the value of cos. A was for the tetrahedron ⅓; and for the octahedron - j, which teaches us that the angles formed by the connected planes of these polyhedra supplement each other, and that the second of these solids is implicitly contained in the first.

  Indeed, let abc, fig. 11, be one of the faces of a tetrahedron, and def the midpoint of three of its edges. Shoot df, ef, d e. Repeat this operation on the other three sides, and pass a cutting plane along all your lines. You will remove four solid angles, which will be small tetrahedra entirely like the one you detached them from.After this subtraction, you will be left with a new polyhedron, which, composed of eight equilateral triangles, can only be an octahedron.

  Now replace on its section ef g, fig. 12, the angloid e f g D.

  Dxe + exy = π. These two angles, which have their vertices at x, are undoubtedly substitutes for each other.

  Because of e x parallel to A y, D x e = D y A.

  I y and A y being perpendicular to B C, the angle that these two lines make is equal to the inclination of the two faces ABC, D B C of the tetrahedron A B C D.

  Likewise, the angle that ex and xy make perpendicular to fg is equal to the inclination of the two faces feg, fyg of the octahedron produced by the four sections made of the tetrahedron ABCD.

  So since these two inclinations are represented, one eg D == A y D supplement of ex y the other by exy supplement of ex D, the first is supplement of the second, and vice versa.

  It would be all the more useless to go into the details of a geometric solution, as the methods by which we have come to the end of profiling the principal elements of the five regular polyhedra solve

**** Construction and Plan of the Stars.

  The stars are regarded by Amateurs as the Turner's masterpiece. Often they excite the astonishment and admiration of people who, unfamiliar with the Tour, cannot conceive of what artifice has succeeded in carrying out such a thorny work.

  A star is only pleasant as long as its rays are well proportioned. A perfection that cannot be achieved whenever you work haphazardly and without a guide.

  The surest way to give each branch an elegant shape is not to undertake any work of this kind until you have discarded it.

  This preliminary does not require that we draw all the rays, which would also be impractical. It suffices to copy faith dre in which are arranged two or three at most of these branches related to the same plane. As all the others are distributed among them in the same way, this projection will highlight their respective situations around their common core; and one will become master of assigning them the size that one believes to be the most advantageous.

  A star is simple or compound.

  By simple star we mean the one whose points have for axes the rays leading from the center of the sphere to the figure centers of the faces of one of the five regular polyhedra.

  If to these branches you add new arrows directed towards the top of the angloids, voxis will have a compound star.

  All the rays which end at the points of one of the five divisions of the ball, pass through the center of the figure of the faces of the polyhedron analogous to this division; and are perpendicular to the planes of these faces.

  It is from the geometric construction of regular polyhedra that we

---
Page 147 CHAP. V. Sect. II. Mathematical principles for the trace, etc.
Pl.18.

  deduced these five divisions. It will still be from the same source that = we will draw the construction of the stars.

**** Single star with four rays.

  Use the plane of the tetrahedron; through the middle of the arcs BCDE, AFED, fig. 13, lead OC, OF; describe concentrically to ABC DEF the inner circle abc of. Divide the small arc bcd in two. Drive cC, cF. Make the angles eCd, aFb equal to the angle b F c = d C c. The two cones aFc, eCc will be the plane of a four-rayed star.

***** Demonstration.

  A x B = 0.7837 (70 °, 30 ') and its complement F O C = 1q, 2163 (109 °, 28'). So the ends C and F of the rays OC, OF meet two of the points of the division into four, and pass through the figure centers of the two faces Ax, B x. So the construction is legitimate.

  This proof extends to the other four polyhedra.

  In the event that the branches appear too thin or too nourished, you will decrease or increase the circle abc

  This remark being general, we will refrain from repeating it. bc = cd = de; and cd + de = bcd. So the arc which supports the foot of the spindles = bcd.

  From the measurement of the FOC angle, we conclude that by placing on a circle two radii at the ends of an FEDC arc of 1q, 2163. (109 ° .28 ') we will construct the plane of a star with four rays without using that of a tetrahedron.

**** Star composed of eight rays.

  Extend one of the radii that pass through the figure centers of two of the faces of the tetrahedron, for example OF. fig.14 until it reaches the apex of angle ABx, and proportion the base of your branches no longer to bcc'd, but to def; cF and c'C forced to approach their axes will leave bare a small arc that is easy to calculate.

  Because CDEF = 1q, 2163 (109 °, 28 ') andBC = 2q - 1q, 2163 = 0.7837 (70 ° .32 '). These values ​​are also those of the interior arcs hcc d, and def

---
Page 148 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.18.

  So bc + cc '+ c'd = 1q, 2163, and de + ef = 0.7837 (70 ° .32').

  But bc + c'd = de + ef. Consequently c'c = 1q, 2163 - (bc + c'd) = 1q, 2163 - (de + ef) = 1q, 2163 - 0.7837 = 0.4326 (38 ° .56 ').

  If from the center of any circle, we draw three radii which make two contiguous angles, one of 1q, 2163 (109 °. 28 '), the other of 0.7857 (70 ° .32') we will have the situation of the axes of an eight-ray star.

**** Single star with six rays.

  See fig.1 5; it frees us from any explanation.

**** Star composed of fourteen rays in the hexahedron.

  Let A B E C D, fig. 16, be the plane of a hexahedron. From the middle of the arc BEC, and the vertex of the angles y /, / ?, draw OE, OR, OA. To the right and to the left of these three axes also lay out the sides of your spindles, to which you will give as a base small arcs abc = c'd e - efg = def.

  AOB = 0.7857 (70 °, 32 ') BOE = 0.6081 (54 ° .44'): so if we place on a circle three rays which make two consecutive angles between them, one of 0 , 7857 the other of 0.6081, we will simplify the construction of the plane of a compound star with fourteen rays.

**** Single star with eight rays.

  Use the plane of an octahedron for help. Lead O B, O F, fig. 17, perpendicular to A E, C G; and mount your branches on arcs abc, cde equal to bcd.

  A x G = 1q, 2163 (109 °. 28) its supplement B O F = 0.7837 (70 ° .32 ')

  So if, in a circle, we shoot two rays that make an angle of 0.7837, we will have, without any prior preparation, the plane of an eight-arrow star.

  Note. By driving on the other side of the diameter AG, an additional radius at the end of an arc equal to FG, we will have the position of a third spindle, the apex of which will be away from point F by 1q, 2163 (109 °. 28 '), and we will find the compound star, which we have extracted from the tetrahedron; which is a continuation of the kind of affinity that we have noticed between this solid and the octahedron.

**** Star composed of fourteen rays in the octahedron.

  On either half of the diameter A G, build a new branch, the base of which covers an arc equal to d e f; and give the profile of the other spindles the same dimension.

  BCDEF = 0.7857 (70 ° .32 '), and FG = 0.6081 (54 ° 44') - So we land on the fourteen-pointed star, taken in the hexahedron. Simple star with twelve rays.

  Operate on the plane of a dodecahedron. Lead through the middle of ABCD, and CDEF, or, which is the same thing, lead perpendicular to the strings AD, CF the two rays OB, OE. Around these two lines, profile the cones aBc, cEe whose bases rest on arcs equal to bcd.

  BxF = ​​1q, 2951 (116 °. 54 '). Its supplement BOE- 0.7048 (63 ° .26 '), This is the measure of the angle that two rays must make, so that we can construct the plane of a twelve-pointed star, without resorting to that of a dodecahedron.

**** Star composed of thirty-two rays in the dodecahedron.

  After pulling O B, OE, fig. 19, as in the previous figure, from the end F of the CF rope, lead to the center FO. The arrangement of these three lines will indicate the order in which the branches of a star with thirty-two rays will be grouped on their common nucleus; and d e f will be the regulating arc of the base of each spindle.

  We know i °. that CDEF = 0.8307 (74 ° .46 '); 2 °. consequently that EF = ½CDEF = 0.41535. (37 ° .25 '); 3 °. that BCDE = 0.7048 (63 ° .26 '). So, since we know the direction of the axes OB, OE, OF, we can rid the plane of the thirty-two-pointed star, borrowed from the dodecahedron, of auxiliary lines that complicate its construction. 0.7048 - 41555 = 0.2896 (26 °. 5 '); this is the measure of the arc this:

**** Single star with twenty rays.

  Choose the plan of an icosahedron, fig. 20; lead OB, OE, perpendicular to. AD, CF, and finish by doing cEd = cBb, aBb = cBb, cEe = aBc.

  AxF = 1q, 5355 (138 ° .11 ') its supplement BOE = 0.4646 (41 ° 49') * Therefore, if we separate two radii by an arc of 0.4646, we will draw the plane from one star to twenty branches, without needing that of an icosahedron.

**** Star composed of thirty-two rays in the icosahedron.

  AOB, OE, fig. 21, add a third radius, pulling OF, from the center O to the end of the CF chord. By this addition your spindles will taper, and their bases will have more support than arcs of the small circle al c d efg, equal to def

  We saw above that CD F F has a roof of 0.8507 (74 ° 46 '); which gives for its half EF, 0.4154 (37 ° 25 ').

  We have likewise found that BOE was 0.4646 (41 ° 49 '); therefore the direction of the three axes O B, OE, O F is known; and this determination frees from any geometrical construction the projection of the star with thirty-two branches, as we can carve in the icosahedron.

  0.4646 - 0.4154 =0.0492 (4 ° .26 '). This is the value of the small arc c c 'dropped by the foot of the two branches aBc, c'Fe.


   This Memorandum was communicated to us by Mr. MILLIN. Lawyer in Château-Chinon; and we thought we would please those of our Readers, who know mathematics, by inserting it here without changing or removing anything.

*** SECTION III. Means of Tracing mechanically, and of executing the five Polyhedra on the Lathe.
**** Tetrahedron.

  We gave in the previous section the means of finding by calculation the value in parts of the radius of the sides of the faces of the polyhedra inscribed in the sphere. We are now going to give in this the means to perform them on the Tour with the greatest regularity; and in favor of amateurs little versed in trigonometric calculations we will add the mechanical means of tracing these sides on the surface of the sphere, starting with the tetrahedron.

  First, develop the circumference of a large circle on a sheet of paper, and divide it into thirteen equal parts; this line, divided in this way, will be used as a scale in the next operation. We will divide the circular line drawn on the cylinder, when we made the ball and should have kept, into three equal parts. This line is nothing more than a large circle of the sphere whose poles are placed at the center of rotation, and which we therefore call the equator.

  The part will be placed in the hemispherical mandrel so that the two poles and one of the division points are flush with the edge of the mandrel. In this state we will draw an arc from one pole to the other.

  We will repeat this operation on the other two division points, then on each of these arcs of a circle we will mark four parts of the scale we have mentioned, starting from one of the poles.

  Finally we will put the part back in a mandrel, and we will trace on the Lathe a small circle which will pass through the three points where these four equal parts end, and we will thus have in all four equal triangles, and consequently a polyhedron with four solid angles and four sides.

  If we measure all the sides of these triangles, we will find that they each have four parts of the division of the circle into thirteen: which satisfies the conditions of the sought problem, which is that the polyhedron is composed of four equilateral triangles.

---
Page 152 i 5 a TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.19.

  If we have operated correctly, that is to say if the three points are all placed on the small circle, the part is straight and the first triangle is in the center of the movement; then we will cut the wood carefully, so as not to let the piece come out of the chuck; and with a good ruler, we will see if the face we made is perfectly straight, and if the angles just end at the circle we have drawn.

  For this operation, we will use a barley grain presented from the front, with which we will begin by detaching a spherical cap half a line thick, driving the tool from the center to the circumference; continue removing layers of the same thickness and with the same precautions, until you are about a quarter of the line from the line. Then take a straight chisel, the bevel of which is a little long and very fine sharp on the oil stone; we plan this surface by presenting it from time to time a good ruler until it is well erected; but whatever care is taken, it is rare that the tool does. not graze a little.

  To avoid this inconvenience, we will raise one of the angles of the chisel sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, by placing a finger of the left hand under it, so that, the resistance being softer, the wood is cut more clean.

  If one is careful to reach only up to the inked circle and carefully line up all the surfaces, one will see the triangles forming with marvelous accuracy, and their sides becoming equal and perfectly straight.

  As we have finished erecting one side, we will immediately polish it by presenting a very flat board, on which we glue polishing paper. This board must have twice the surface area you want to polish, in order to be able to walk it in all directions, and to completely erase the traces of the tool.

  If it happens that the part comes out of the chuck before it is finished, it can easily be put back, first by judging by sight, whether it turns fairly straight; then approaching the support quite close, we would present a pencil to the face of the piece; and by the place where the line would be marked, one would very easily judge that this side should retract a little; what will be done with the tip of a boxwood mallet.

  When a first side is rotated, we will go to a second; and since the angles of the tetrahedron are at the surface of the sphere, it seems natural to think that the part must fit in the same mandrel. However, it is not. On the one hand, the flat parts no longer touch the bottom of the

---
Page 153 CHAP. V. Sect. III. Means of Tracing Mechanically, etc.

mandrel, while the spherical parts still squint there. On the other hand, the solid angles penetrate the wood of the mandrel, and therefore the part is off-center. It will therefore be appropriate, before disturbing the room, to apply with a fly of glue, on the faceturned, a wedge of roughly cylindrical shape, having a diameter of about half or a third of the face, and a height equal to that of the spherical portion displaced by the tool. We give at its upper end the shape of a spherical cap having the diameter of the ball on which we operate; which can be easily obtained, using a gauge taken from the ball itself. This way, when the workpiece is turned over, this shim will fit exactly on the inside of the chuck, and will hold it securely against the force of the tool.

**** Hexahedron.
  The hexahedron fig. io, developed, fig. n, is a solid with six faces, each presenting a square: thus, any cube, like a dez to play, is a hexahedron.

  To execute this solid, we must start by making a ball, on which we will trace the faces of the hexahedron: and here is how we should do it.

  We will divide the line originally drawn, or equator, into four equal parts; and, as on a spherical part, the spacing of the compass, at a quarter of the circumference, could vary the points at the points of division, it will be safer to divide the line into eight parts; but we will clearly only mark two in two parts. These points of division will determine the center of four faces; the other two will have their center at the two poles.

  We will divide the distance between two of these centers into two equal parts; then from one of the centers, on which we will place the point of a compass open at this distance, we will draw a circle; this operation will be repeated on the other five center points.

  There remain, between these circles, triangles, the sides of which are arcs of a circle: the center must be found, which is easily done in the following manner.

  A flexible ruler, made with a piece of a pendulum spring, will be placed on one of the angles of this triangle and on the center of the circle opposite to that angle. We'll draw a line in that direction. We will do the same

---
Page 154 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.19,

 on another angle, and the point where these two lines intersect will be the center of the triangle. We will thus determine eight new points, through which we will pass six concentric circles to the first six. These new circles determine the spherical caps that the tool must move.

  Everything being thus traced, we will put the ball in the hemispherical mandrel that we described while teaching to make the balls in the first volume, and we will place one of the centers at the point of rotation. Cut the wood to the circle marked on the ball, reserving a small tenon about six lines in diameter in the middle. We will then make another mandrel, in which we will dig a hole, to receive this tenon, and the front of which will be carefully drawn up, on which the finished face will be applied.

  The same operation will be done on the second side, reserving a tenon similar to the first. These two faces being erected, we will put the part back in the first mandrel, and we will move on to the third face, to which we will also leave a tenon. To make the fourth, we will use the second mandrel.

  The fifth and sixth will be done by the same means; only, we will not reserve a tenon for the last that we finish erecting.

  All that remains is to remove the studs. The first two will easily be made to disappear, by placing those of the opposite faces in the second mandrel. To remove the other three, one of the following two means can be used.

  The first is to fix the part with a glue fly on a well plane mandrel. To put it back exactly in the center, we will draw on the front surface of the mandrel a circle with the center of rotation as its center, and the diagonal of one of the faces as its diameter. By placing the part in this circle so that the four angles are around the circumference, you can be sure that it is perfectly centered.

  The second means that we recommend to use preferably is reduced to making a new mandrel cylindrically hollowed out to the diameter of the diagonal of the face. When hollowing out this mandrel, take the greatest precaution to achieve just the required diameter. If the hole was too wide, the part wouldn't fit in it; if it were too narrow, the angles would be damaged, or imprint on the mandrel, and then one could no longer be sure of the parallelism of the faces.

  There is a precaution that should not be overlooked when shooting a

Pl.19.

  hexahedron; it is to make the two faces with wood standing first; otherwise, and if we did them last, the wood being taken in the wrong direction, we would throw up splinters which would spoil the surfaces already finished. We owe this observation to our experience of performing a piece of the same kind, but much more delicate, of which we will speak shortly, a star at six points.

**** Octahedron.

  The octahedron, or solid with eight triangular faces, fig. 12, developed, fig. 13, is traced in the same way as the hexahedron: when we have determined the six points which served as its center, and drawn the six circles that touch, we take the center of the eight triangles that are between these circles. Their center will be the center of the eight triangles that make up the octahedron, and whose limits are given by the centers of the three neighboring circles. We can draw circles circumscribed to these faces to better judge when they turn perfectly round.

  We will put the ball thus traced in the ring mandrel, and we will make the eight faces one after the other by removing the wood between the arcs of circles which determine the limits. You have to cover the faces with a wedge as they are completed, as we said when talking about the tetrahedron, and take great care to center each face. The slightest eccentricity would make the solid lose the regularity which gives it all its merit.

**** Dodecahedron.

  The dodecahedron, fig. x4, developed, fig. 15, is a solid whose surface presents twelve regular and equal pentagons.

  We will first turn by the means indicated a perfectly round ball, and we will keep the line drawn before the operation, on the middle of the cylinder, and which we have called the equator of the sphere.

  We will begin by developing this line on paper, and divide it into twenty-three equal parts, to serve as a scale in the next operation.

  We will then divide, on the same ball, the equator into ten equal parts; then lead ten semicircles, passing through each of the division points and through the two poles, and number these ten semicircles 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., up to ten, to make them easier to distinguish.

---
Page 156 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.19

  Then take, with a spring compass, two parts of the scale, equal to two twenty-thirds of the circumference; and placing one of the points of the compass on one of the poles, we will draw a circle parallel to the equator. One will then carry one of the points of the compass on the semi-circumference, at the place where it intersects the circle drawn around the pole, and the other on the same semi-circumference outside this circle and on the side of the equator. . We will fix the latter, and we will draw a circle which will touch the first by a single point: we will do the same on the semi-circumferences 3, 5, 7, and 9; and we will thus have five circles which will all touch each other, and which will all come flush with the first, at five points equally distant from each other.

  This operation will be repeated exactly at the other pole; but instead of placing the compass on the odd semicircles, we will put it on those marked 2, 6, 8 and 10.

  The centers of these twelve circles give the centers of the twelve pentagons, forming the surface of the dodecahedron. Their limits are fixed by the centers of the five triangles which surround each circle. These centers, which can be easily found by the means we have indicated in speaking of the hexahedron, determine the position of the five angles of the pentagon.

  It is well to notice that the measurement of two-twenty-thirds which we have prescribed to take for the opening of compasses is not geometrically exact; but it is sufficient for practice, which can never achieve mathematical precision.

  The dodecahedron being thus drawn, it is necessary to put the ball in a mandrel with ring, where it just enters. We will put the center point of one of the faces perfectly in the center of the movement; first, at simple sight, and when the eye no longer perceives any movement, we take a good magnifying glass, and fixing again the point of center, we will see if, while turning, it describes a small circle, or if it spins exactly on itself. When this last result has been achieved, we will tighten the ring which joins the telescope to the body of the mandrel, and the ball will be firmly fixed in its position.

  We again recommend starting with the faces that are upright, or closest; then by those which adjoin them, finishing with those which are crooked; without this precaution, and if we end with standing timber, we run the risk of splinters, which would spoil the faces already made and their angles.

**** Icosahedron.

  The icosahedron, fig. 16, expanded, fig. 17, is a solid whose surface has twenty equilateral triangles equal to each other.

  The way to draw it is the same as the one we used for the dodecahedron. The centers of the twenty triangles, which are formed by the meeting of the twelve circles, become the centers of the twenty faces of the icosahedron, the limits of which are given by the centers of the three neighboring circles; we can draw circles circumscribed to these faces to judge more easily if its go round, and we will do well to mark the centers with ink so that we can more easily center them. The ball, thus traced, will be mounted in the ring mandrel, and the faces will be turned one after the other by the procedures described above.

  The former do not present great difficulties; but when there is a certain number determined, the circles drawn around those which remain to be made disappear under the tool, and only the center point marked in ink remains, so that it becomes difficult to put them in the center.

  There is yet another difficulty; This is because the part only exhibits angles to the tool, formed by the faces already made, we must start the wood with great care not to damage these angles; and this observation also relates to the dodecahedron.

  It is quite ordinary that an Amateur wants to execute these five polyhedra to adorn his cabinet. In this case, you have to take them in balls of the same diameter, and use the same mandrel for the last three polyhedra.

*** SECTION IV. Stars in the Five Polyhedra.
Pl.21.

  After having, in the previous section, taught to make the five regular bodies which are caught in the sphere, we are now going to give the means of practicing in their interior a star whose number of rays equal that of the faces of the polyhedron. The base of these rays rests on the faces of an envelope-like polyhedron, and reserved in the center, and their point passes through bezels made on the faces

---
Page 158 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.21.

  of the outer polyhedron. We can therefore see that we had to reserve them by forming these faces on the Tour.

  A similar star is a very pleasant piece when performed with precision and regularity; but the operations necessary to succeed require a great deal of dexterity, lightness of hand, and a few special tools which we are going to detail, and at the same time teach how to do it, since their shape is determined by that of the part that is being used. wants to run.

  We will forge, if we have the convenience, or we will take in good flat steel, a strong line and a half thick, four, five and six in width, as needed, hooks which the form FIG. i 4, PI. 23; they will be about five to six inches long without the handle.

  Seven or eight hooks will be made like this; if only the beak b, c, must be of increasing lengths, from half line to half line. The smaller one, which is the one used first, will have two or so lines of beak length in all; which will reduce it inside to a good line. These tools must cut by the end b, by the outer part a, and by the spherical part c. The stem c, e, must be rounded from the inside, and the angles only blunt from the outside. The outer part a must form a somewhat obtuse angle with the rod, equal to that formed by the inclination of the radius of the star on the face of the polyhedron.

  Dotted lines indicate the gradual increase in square brackets.

  The reason why the first must be so small, is that it must enter the hole or bezel, between the bezel itself and the point, which not being at this moment at the size where it should be, leaves little room to insert the hook. But it is not enough that you introduce it, you have to cut into the wood to the left, and as long as you give the rod some strength, there is not much length left on the hook to dig.

  The second, which, like all the others, must be the same as the previous one, differs only in the length of the hook a, b, c. This length must be such that when it has been introduced at an angle into the groove produced by the first, touching the spoke from the back, and put back flat on the support, it does not yet cut into the wood. The third and the following must follow the same progression; but the rod must be a little stronger, to better withstand the stresses that are made to it.

  All the rays of the star must be equal in size and length,

---
Page 159 CHAP. V. SECT. IV. Stars in the Five Polyhedra.
Pl.21.

 , and the polyhedron on the faces of which their base is inscribed must be similar to the exterior polyhedron, and have for radius one third of that of Pl. the sphere. To achieve this, you have to make several calibers, one to fix the length of the spoke, another to determine the size at the base, and a third for the diameter of the bezel.

  Each ray must have its point on the surface of the sphere or ball. It is therefore from this point, which should not be altered, that the measurement of their length starts.

  We will draw on paper an equilateral triangle A B C, fig. 24, Pl 21 equal to one of the faces of the tetrahedron on which we assume that we are operating. We will make another triangle similar and concentric to the first “a, b, c”, to which we will give the dimensions fixed for the interior polyhedron. By inscribing the circle d, e, f in this small triangle, we will obviously have the base of the points of the star. If we then lower the perpendicular D, b, we will have the distance from a face of the interior polyhedron to a homologous face of the exterior polyhedron, and consequently we will determine the length that we must give to the gauge fig. 11, from the notch we see there in a. You put the end of this gauge on the face of the inner polyhedron, and judge how much wood you still have to carry, by the distance from the face of the outer polyhedron to the notch. This gauge, which is taken from a thin copper blade, is bent at a right angle from above, so that it can be gripped more easily on the workbench; it can be advantageously replaced by the sliding square, fig. 7, PL. 2.

  With another blade, of the same copper, we will make another fork gauge, ^. 12, PI. 21, which is used to measure and adjust the size of the spokes at their base. We made this fork about as wide at the top as at the bottom, because when we destablishes the diameter of the base, the tip of the spoke is still far from that which it should have, this part not having to end until all the rest is completed, given the fear of accidents which could happen.

  A third gauge made of the same metal, fig. 13, is roughly similar to the previous one, except on each side, is a shoulder; a which rests on the surface of the outer polyhedron, while the two legs, by their spacing, serve to determine the diameter of the hole or telescope.

  We could replace these last two calibers by compasses, but we advise however to use preferably calibers which can never vary.

  It is customary to form around the hole, or bezel on each side,

Pl.21.

  a small molding, such as a strip or heel. If it is a rod, it must be formed, both on the outside and on the side of the hole. Make with a piece of steel, two to three lines wide, one line thick, and four to five inches long, a speckle with one line in diameter, Fig. 2. This tool is quite difficult to do well, to cut cleanly, because we don't often have files, rat tails, which are quite small. It is, however, of the greatest finesse, as well as files of all shapes. When the tool is completed, the bevel well done, and the two points of the semicircle very sharp, it will be soaked and returned to the color of gold. But it’s not easy to give it the smoothness of edge that any tool that must cut clean must have, since there isn’t an oil stone thin enough to fit in. We have supplemented this advantageously with a strip of red copper, a thin line thin, well drawn, and rounded from end to end on one of its sides. We will put a little oil and very fine emery on this round part, and we will sharpen the inside of the bevel, which will produce the polish and liveliness of the edge. Sharpen the top flat on a stone in regular oil, and 1 tool will cut perfectly.

  We make a second handkerchief, absolutely the same, at the end of a hook, like the one in fig. to complete the rod inside the hole.

  If you prefer a heel, fig. 3, or other molding, make the appropriate tools with files, and polish them in the same way, to sharpen the edge, with round, flat copper blades, and the like.

  In the rooms we are dealing with, we find wood in different senses.

  For Je bois tranché, it is a tool that has worked perfectly for us. It is a very narrow chisel, as of two lines at most, having a single bevel at the end, and another on the left side a, fig. 1. The body of this tool can be three to four lines wide; it is reduced to two at the end, and a line and a half thick.

  For wood grain, a barley grain is used proportionate to the opening of the bezel.

  We'll make two or three more little donkeys, one and a half to two lines thick, two, three, and four lines wide, and six to eight inches long without the handle. We recommend this length, because when it comes to cutting wood at the bottom of a hole, which is about an inch deep, not including the spacing of the wedge from the support, it

Pl.21.

  The power lever must be able to overcome resistance without effort, in order to cut the wood cleanly and without grazing, and to unite the plane on which the base of each point is.

  To determine the thickness to be given to the faces of the polyhedron, we use a kind of barley grain, angled at a square, fig. 6. The staff a is pressed against the face, and the tip of the tool, when cutting into the wood, determines, in an invariable manner, the thickness to be given to the face. There are cases where we need to have one of the same shape, on the left: it is represented, fig. 7: we will also obtain a fly, angled to the left, fig. 5. Finally, we will have a bent barley grain, fig. 8, with a slightly long beak, to cut and separate pieces, which hardly hold anything any more.

  Having thus equipped yourself with all the necessary tools and instruments, it is time to proceed with the operation.

**** Star in a Tetrahedron.

  We will start by preparing three washers, fig. 26, which we will need to be able to put the part back into the mandrel as we have formed the first three faces of the tetrahedron. These washers, which must be taken care to take crosswise, have for diameter that of the circle circumscribed to the face of the tetrahedron, and are drilled in the center of a hole of two lines for the passage of the tenon intended to form the tip of the star. This hole is indicated in the figure by the dotted lines a, a.

  They will be prepared with a saw; and after having drilled a hole in the center of a little less than two lines, we will mount them to turn them on a smooth shaft as we have taught fromIn our first Volume, speaking of spinning wheel hubs, see fig. 47, PL 17, T I.

  When the circumference is perfectly round, we will draw up the side which must apply to the face of the polyhedron, and which must therefore be perfectly flat. We will then turn the other surface, which must have a spherical cap, having for radius that of the ball on which we operate.

  If we're going to spin these washers in the air, we'll put them in putty on a mandrel. We will first turn the flat face, and give it, roughly, the diameter it should have.

  We will take a second mandrel a little less wide than the washer. We will form in the center a clean tenon to receive just the hole of the washer.

---
Page 162 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 20 and 21
  On the face of the mandrel, and about the middle of the spoke, a light barley grain will be made; and on this circumference, we will put three small points of steel wire, which we will leave to exceed the surface of a line and a half or two, and which we will flatten with a file, by forming two kinds of bevels: we will insert the washer on the tenon, and with a blow of the mallet we will fix it on the three points to prevent it from turning, and we will round the second face to the curvature of the gauge taken on the ball.

  After having prepared the three washers, we will put in a ring mandrel, quite right, the ball on which we have traced the centers and the limits of the four faces of the tetrahedron. We will choose the one of these four centers that is standing timber, or the closest. This is the one we will put in the center of rotation first, with the precautions we have recommended.

  We will first do the first face, by the means we have taught above; but we will reserve a tenon in the center, which just enters the hole in the washers. Moreover, we will form the face, as if it were plane, and reaching up to the circumference of the circle which indicates its limits.

  Fig. 27 represents the result of this first operation.
  We will cover this face with a washer which will be inserted on the tenon, and putting the part back in a mandrel, we will proceed to make the second face; the third and fourth will be done in the same way.

  As you operate on the second face, the washer placed on the adjacent face snips and ends up presenting a flat slice. By placing the second washer on the second face, we will put a fly of glue on this slice; which will bring the two washers together and consolidate them.

  When the four faces are thus prepared, we will put the piece back in the chuck, the wood upright in front, to hollow out the solid, reserving the star and its core. We will start by thinning the end of the tenon which must form the point of the star a little, without however finishing this point; it just needs to be shaped like a truncated cone.

  We will draw, with a grain of barley, a circle to determine the diameter of the bezel, which should have about eight to nine lines; and inside this circle, a groove perpendicular to the face of the polyhedron will be made with a square donkey's beak, the depth of which is determined by line b D, fig. 24. We will continue to give the point the conical shape, gradually approaching the size determined for the base.

---
Page 163 CHAP. V. Sect. IV. Stars in the Five Polyhedra.
Pl. 20 and 21

  Then we will take the first hook fig.14, Pl 23. It must enter freely enough from the front: but so that 1 thickness of each face is equal by 11 all, we will use the barley grain shown in fig.6, PL 21: it is from the line that he will have described that we will start to dig with the hook, until we have arrived at the face of the interior polyhedron.

  When the hook shank has reached the edge of the telescope, the tool no longer bites. Then we will take the second, which we will introduce at an angle, and which, when it is flat on the support block, must not yet touch the bottom of the groove, started towards the left. We will therefore deepen it by taking a little wood at a time, following the direction given by the first tool; and withdrawing it imperceptibly when the step goes up, as we have recommended, and as we should always do. With the third hook we will finish giving the interior of the polyhedron the spherical shape, by means of which the star will be released, when the four faces are finished.

  We are perhaps emphasizing these precautions a little too much; but the forgetting that we have made of it ourselves has caused us so many accidents that we are not afraid to bore our readers by repeating it over and over.

  During this work, we will often measure with the gauges, both for the size of the base of the spoke, and for the length to give it. When this has been achieved, and by placing the end of the gauge fig. 11, on the face of the inner polyhedron, we will see that the heel has touched the outer face, or that it isVery little is needed, then we will finish giving the point the conical shape: and as the one which concerns us at this moment is for standing timber, the length of the point will be for wood grain. We will use a grain of barley proportioned to the telescope, and we will remove a little wood at a time, until the ray has acquired the exact shape it should have. that we gave at the beginning of this article, and that the side is straight. Then we will take it to its last finesse, by cutting into the wood only above the diameter, for fear of breaking the point, which becomes very delicate.

  This point can be finished by cutting into the wood in its entire length; but very little must be taken at a time, and even, to avoid accidents, we will do well to raise the wedge of the support, and to present the tool obliquely to the axis of the point.

  We can even, given its extreme delicacy, not finish it with a tool, two or three lines towards the point, but leave it a

---
Page 164 TURNER'S MANUAL,
Pl. 20 and 21

  a little bigger than necessary, and give it the last stroke with a small, flat, semi-soft file. It will not be broken or scratched, and this precaution is especially necessary for cross or sliced ​​wood.

  It is just a matter of giving this part of the tetrahedron all the necessary finish and cleanliness. We will perfectly unite the surface of the bottom with the face of the third hook, because we must remember that these hooks cut on three sides; and for this, we will raise the wedge of the support, so that the tool is presented to the wood, inclined to its surface. Care should also be taken that this surface is very flat, which, at the bottom of the hole, is not very easy to see and perform. With the same hook we will unite, as much as possible, the interior surface of the polyhedron, removing the tool parallel to oneself. Finally, with a chisel with a bevel, a little wide, and which cuts with the greatest finesse, we will unite and perfectly erect the exterior surface of the polyhedron.

  It is at this moment that we will make the molding we want around the bezel. Since the tool we talked about needs to cut very sharp, this molding should come out very cleanly from under the tool.

  It is good to warn our readers here that often these moldings are done separately on circles, which are then brought back, and which are glued on the bezel.

  It is understandable that, in this way, we were able to make the telescope much wider, and thus the work loses much of its merit. We therefore advise removing these ornaments, which are moreover contrary to the purity of the design of this piece, and which always give rise to the suspicion of some deception.

  Before moving on to the second surface, you have to take care of some absolutely essential new parts.

  The washers which have been used until now, as long as there is only one tenon on each side, can no longer be used for those where the star point has ended; we must therefore make specific ones, which we call Bouchons, flg. 25.

  We will take a piece of hard wood, such as boxwood, service tree, etc. about three and a half inches in length, which will be rotated cylindrically to the diameter of the circle inscribed in the face of the outer tetrahedron. We practice at the end a span of a length equal to the distance between the two polyhedra. This range a must have for diameter, on the side of the cylinder, that of the telescope, and go a little while decreasing towards its lower part. We will make in the center a conical hole of the same

Pl. 20 and 21

  shape as the radius of the star indicated in the figure by dotted lines. However, this hole does not have to follow exactly this shape throughout its length, the main thing is that its base matches perfectly with that of the spoke. This plug will be detached from the cylinder, leaving it a little more height from the reach than the thickness of the washers which were used at the start of the operation. In this state, we place this plug on the point of the star, and we give its outer part the spherical shape, using the gauge that was used to form the first washers.

  It is understandable that such a stopper gives the point, released on all sides, the same solidity as if it were still in the mass, and that the spherical part receives the pressure of the mandrel, like the previous washers, to put the part in the mass. center. We will immediately make three similar corks; but since they have to fit perfectly with the glasses and spikes you are going to make, the safest way is to do them only as needed.

  We will therefore put this stopper on the point that we have just finished, and we will move on to the second side, always being careful to choose the one where the wood is closest to the standing wood, and leaving the first washers on the other two sides.

  When it comes tothe fourth, we will work it as surely as we did the first, since by means of the plugs the star is held in its place, and it cannot move on either side.

  We will not repeat, for the other sides, what we said about the first one: it is always the same work, the same precautions. When the four faces are finished, the three plugs will be removed, and the star will be seen detached from the body in which it was taken.

  Fig. 1, Pl. 20, shows this fully finished piece.

  To place this polyhedron in a cabinet, we will turn a pedestal on which we will raise a pedestal surmounted by a small very sharp cone, at the top of which we will pierce a very small hole; we will insert an extremely fine steel point, in which we will enter the polyhedron by one of its angles. In this way it will be placed in the most advantageous position where it can be seen, and without running the risk of being broken or blunted.

Pl. 20 and 21

**** Star in a Hexahedron.
  Almost all of the details we have gone into on how to make a star in a tetrahedron are applicable to the other four polyhedra. There are only a few peculiar to these last four.

  We will divide the ball as we indicated for the hexahedron. We will start with the face where the wood is standing, and to do so, we will grab the ball in the ring mandrel. We will reserve in the center a tenon strong enough to be able to enter and hold securely in the reach of another mandrel which we will prepare to receive it, and we will reach it until close to the circle which we must have described on the ball. We will see at the end of this article why we should not reach this circle the first time.

  We will put the part back in the mandrel of which we have just spoken, and we will fix it there by means of the tenon reserved on the first face. By this means we will be assured of the perfect parallelism of this first face with the second, which we will do in the same way and by reserving a similar tenon. The part will then be returned to the ring chuck; the tenons reserved for the two faces made are sufficient to hold it firmly there. The third face will be well centered by means of the point marked at its center and the two faces already prepared, and we will make it similar to the other two.

  The fourth and sixth will be in the mandrel which was used for the second, and the fifth in the ring mandrel, where it will be centered by the same procedures and. even more easily than the third, since there are already four completed sides.

  All that remains is to prepare the tenons to form the points of the star, and to, hollow out the interior of the polyhedron, which is done in the ring chuck, and in the same way as in the tetrahedron.

  We will start with the upright wood face, and then move on to the one opposite it, by placing on the point of the first a stopper made on the same principles as those which were used for the tetrahedron, but whose shape and dimensions are determined by those of the face of the hexahedron.

  To dig the interior of the room, we need new gauges, which we will do in the same way as those of the tetrahedron, by tracing on paper a square equal to that of one of the faces of the hexahedron; in the middle of this square we will inscribe another which is concentric with the first, and whose

---
Page 167 CHAP. V. sect. IV. Stars in the Five Polyhedra.
Pl. 20 and 21

  faces are parallel to those of the first. The circle inscribed in the small square will give the base of the points of the star, and the perpendicular lowered from one face of the same inner square to the corresponding one of the outer square gives the distance that must be between the two polyhedra.

  The tools used to finish the interior and exterior of the hexahedron, as well as the star points, are those we described in the tetrahedron article.

  By finishing the faces of the polyhedron, we will repair any small irregularities that may be there, and we will finish making the angles very sharp.

  It is for this reason that we recommended at the beginning of this article not to quite reach the circle drawn on the ball.

  Fig. 3, Pl. 20, shows this fully finished piece.

**** Star in the Octahedron.

  Since the faces of the octahedron are usually drawn on the ball, the methods and tools used for the tetrahedron will be used for the execution. We only recommend that you take extra care when working, because as the number of faces increases, the holes from which the tips come out become smaller, and therefore it is more difficult to insert the hooks. In addition, as the number of tips increases in proportion, we can, if we are not careful, damage the tips that have already finished, by working those around them, or removing them.er the material that should be used to form those that we have not yet started.

  Fig. 5, PL 20, shows the star in the fully completed octahedron.

  We can easily feel that the interior surface of these polyhedra cannot have faces parallel to those of the exterior. These are flat, and one can only produce with a hook, in the interior of a part, cylindrical and spherical portions. It is the latter form that we recommend performing, because it is the one that removes the greatest possible amount of material; all that remains is that contained between the solid angles and the spherical cap. This cannot be moved by any means.

**** Star in the Dodecahedron.
  We will divide the ball, as for the polyhedron of the same name, and we will execute the part in the ring mandrel that was used for the octahedron. V, fig. 7, pl 20

---
Page 168 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 20 and 21

  The operations are absolutely the same as for the other stars; and it would be falling into tedious repetitions to detail them again here.

**** Star in the Icosahedron.

  After having described the way of making the icosahedron, it is useless to stop to detail the way of making a star with twenty points in this solid, fig. 17, PI. 20: it is the same operation as for the preceding ones, but the difficulties increase with the number of points, which almost entirely occupy the faces of the interior polyhedron, and which are so close together, that one can only with the most great difficulty in making the tool act between them.

  We can increase the merit and the difficulty of all the pieces that we have just described, by detaching in their interior one or more spherical envelopes.We will give the means of performing them by teaching in the following article to make these stars in a ball .

**** Star in a Ball.

  We can make a star with four, six, eight, twelve and twenty points in a ball, as in a polyhedron. The principles for drawing them on the surface of the ball are the same. The whole difference is that we don't face it. Or will use the ring mandrel and the tools that were used to hollow out the polyhedron and form the points of the star. The way to operate is absolutely the same.

  Suppose we want to make a six pointed star. We will begin by tracing on the ball six circles having the same center as the six faces of the hexahedron, and for diameter the opening which we have determined to give to each telescope.

  When we have hollowed out circularly with a telescope, we will form the radius until close to its base, taking away all the surrounding wood; then with a hook at the curvature that we want to give to the core, and that we will do on purpose, we will round this part around the base of the point; but it should be observed that the beak of this hook is only a little more than half the length of the distance between the bases of the two points, which can be ascertained on a drawing made expressly for each number of points that we want to take in a ball.

---
Page 169 CHAP. V. Sect. IV. Stars in the Five Polyhedra.

  The smaller the glasses, the more the difficulty of making the stars will increase; but this very difficulty demands great care when digging.

  As it is essential, in these kinds of works, that the light penetrate to the bottom of the recess, if one is not working on a fine day, or that the Lathe is not exposed so that the day, coming from right, gives to the bottom of the mandrel, it is then more advantageous to work in the evening, because we can easily arrange the light, so that its rays are introduced into the interior of the part, as we work to dig it.

  When we have finished a point, we must place a suitable stopper, which is held in place by a small bead which presses on the ball, and which is spherical above. By means of this stopper, which must exactly replace the material removed, the part can be securely put back in its mandrel, without fear that the already finished tips will be damaged.

  We again recommend that you take extra care when drilling the conical hole in the inside of the stopper, so that at least the base of this hole exactly embraces that of the spoke; without this precaution, the finished points would toss, and it would be impossible to do the last ones with exactitude.

  See fig. 18, PL 21, the shape to be given to this stopper which must be proportionate to the length of the tip.

**** Star in the center of several spherical envelopes 3 detached from each other.

  Fig. 16, PL 20, represents a star, with six points, taken in a ball which contains two others. After all that we have said about the work of the other pieces containing stars, we will add very little here on how to make the tools specific to these stars. These arecircular hooks, which should be formed according to the various circles they have to describe.

  If you think about it, you will feel that the hooks which form the first interval, between the first two balls, cannot form the one between the second and the third, given the difference in the radii of these circles, and their different curvature. . We will therefore trace the outer size of the ball on paper. a

Pl. 20 and 21
  A second circle inside will give the thickness. A third will give the distance between the first two balls. A fourth will give the thickness of the second ball. The fifth will give the distance between the second and the third; finally a sixth will give the thickness of this third ball. The seventh will give the size of the core on which the star tips are placed, if it is to be a sphere; otherwise we will use hooks with straight noses, if we want it to be a cube for the six-pointed star; a triangle for the one at eight; a pentagon for the one with twelve, and a triangle for the one with twenty, depending on whether you make a star with six, eight, twelve or twenty points in the ball.
  Figs. 4, 5 and 6, PL23, give a fair idea of ​​these hooks. We see that there are as many curvatures as we want to make balls. Here is how these curves should be drawn relative to the tool shank.

  We will extend the line d, e, fig. 19, PI. 19, and place at e a point of a compass open to the radius of the circle to be detached by the hook, and the other on the extension of the line at point g.

  From this point, as the center, we will draw the portion of the circle c, e; then enlarging the opening of the compass by the distance that we want to leave between the two envelopes, and always keeping the same center, we will draw the portion of the circle b, /, and we will thus determine the width of the tool, which must decrease gradually as you approach the shank, as in carpenters' donkeys, so that the opening made by the cutting part is wide enough so that the rest of the tool does not experience too much friction.

  You can make up to three of these hooks on each bend, the beaks of which go forward. The first starts the groove, and the others finish it. They will be made on portions of a circle drawn according to the radius of those which are on the drawing; and in order not to confuse them, we will mark each species with a particular mark, such as A, B, C, and each of them by the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. If we make the bezel as flared as shown in fig. iG, PI. 20, the hooks at the bottom of the third ball must have a very short beak, since there is very little distance between the telescope and the spoke.The first telescope can be opened a little less, and the other two a little more , but we must always keep the conical shape in the hole, so that the plugs that we must put there hold each ball very firmly, as well as the point: for, considering the multiplicity of balls, and their little thickness, if they wobble even a little, we risk-

---
Page 171 CHAP. V. Sect IV- Stars in the five Polyhedra.

  would risk breaking everything when it comes to the last one. These caps must therefore be made with the greatest care.

  We will begin by ending the star, leaving a sufficient thickness for the ball to then find two more; and for that, when we have hollowed out circularly around the point, and deep enough so that the thickness to be reserved is assured, we will make a barley grain with a shoulder, like the one, fig. 6, PI. ai, where the tip is away from that shoulder, whatever it takes to determine that thickness. We will therefore reserve a good line for the thickness of the first ball; as much for the distance between the first and the second; as much for the thickness of the second; as much for the distance between the second and the third; finally, as much for the thickness of the third: which makes a total of five lines, which can be reduced to four, by reducing the interval between the envelopes and their thickness. The thinner the envelopes, the closer they will be, the more merit the piece will have. Thus the barley kernel should have at most five lines between the shoulder and the tip; and the hook with which to dig must be, at the curvature of a circle, five lines less in radius than that of the ball. Figs. 16, PI. 20, and that 19, PI. ai, will make sensitive the measurements to be taken, and the curvature to be given to the brackets, as we just said.

  We will hollow out all that is of wood beyond the small circle, between the points, which by this means we will release, by fitting to each bezel a stopper similar to that in fig. 18, which we have shown opposite. - screw of a telescope, fig. 20, and of a point a which must enter therein, as can be judged by the two lines punctuated on the surface of the stopperfig. 18.

  These plugs must be made with great care, and take over the entire surface of the scope, so that, when it comes to loosening the balls, there is no sloshing.

  If you make six points at the star, each of them will rest on one side of a cube. If it's eight, twelve, or twenty, it will be an octahedron, dodecahedron, or icosahedron. When the star is completely finished, use as many shouldered barley grains as there are different depths to cut, so that the thicknesses of the balls and their distances are equal everywhere. One can also make, for this use, a stepped tool, fig. 14, PI. 21, to which we will do as many steps as we want to tear off the envelopes. We will give the length to each of

---
Page 172 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 20 and 21

  these steps in the thickness of each envelope, plus the distance that must be left between two.

  The shank of this tool will be given a shoulder that will bear on the outer shell of the ball, to prevent the tool from penetrating too far into the interior.

  By means of these steps, one will draw at once, and with great accuracy, the circles which indicate the distance which one wishes to leave between the two envelopes, and one will make a small shoulder there, against which the circular hook s 'will press even more easily than on a dash of barley grain.

  We are now going to give a means of directing the hooks more surely, cpii require a very practiced hand.

  We make with a piece of copper a kind of circular gauge, fig. 15, PI. 21, embracing a portion of the sphere which exceeds the aperture of the telescope by about three lines on each side. An oval hole a will be drilled towards one-third of this caliber, by means of which it will be fixed to the shank of the tool with a flat-head screw.

  We will introduce the hook in the telescope; it will be placed exactly in the position it should occupy; and in this state we will stop the caliber so that it rests on the cap of the sphere. The shorter portion should be placed on the right, and the longest on the left. With these precautions the tool will not be able to deviate from the direction it should follow, and we will not be afraid to pierce the envelopes when separating them. Then, as much as possible, each surface should be united, ending it with the longest hook, in the meantime, j? G. 19, by the two adjacent glasses.

  When we have detached two portions of balls, by a telescope, we will put the cap back on, and we will continue the operation, until they are completely detached from each other.

  What we have just said about the means to be used to detach several balls from one another, can also be understood from several polyhedra; but this operation presents many more difficulties than the first, especially if the ball on which we want to detach them is very small; the fewer faces the polyhedra have, the more the difficulty will increase. It would even be impossible to overcome it on the hexahedron and on the tetrahedron, unless the ball were very large.

  All the operations that we have described so far tend to detach in a sphere several equally divided envelopes. However, it is also possible to detach several envelopes, although under

---
Page 173 CHAP. V. Sect. IV. Stars in the Five Polyhedra.
Pl. 20 and 21

  different divisions; thus, in a ball pierced with six spectacles, one can be detached with eight openings, which will contain a third with twelve divisions.

  Usually, we'll start by making six divisions on the surface of the ball, and open six spectacles and dig until we reach the surface of the second shell. Care must be taken to reserve, in the middle of one of the six spectacles, a tenon which will serve to set the internal mass in place, when the first envelope is entirely detached with the aid of the circular hooks which we have taught here. 'use.

  We will trace the eight divisions on the second envelope, putting it in a mandrel by the tenon. This tenon determines one of the poles by means of which the other pole and the equator can easily be found.

  With a little care and attention, we will make the eight openings on this second surface; after which they will be detached by introducing the hook through the outer bezel; another tenon will be reserved with the help of which the twelve divisions will be traced on the third surface. When the divisions of these interior surfaces will not give faces parallel to each other, as in the tetrahedron and the octahedron, to finish each of the glasses, it is necessary to put the part back in a mandrel using the mastic: if, on the contrary, the openings are parallel between they, as in the hexahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, we will use, to make the first, the tenon reserved for one of them. For the second, which is the oneon which the tenon is located, we will put the chuck piece on a staff that just enters the bezel that we have just finished. The third will be putty, the fourth and the second, and so on until they are all completed. It is easy to see that the openings of the different envelopes not being opposite each other, it is impossible to pass the points of a star through them. The material left in the middle of the last one will be given the shape of a vase, a cup, or whatever.

  We can also make a star, the points of which will be on the surface of the last envelope; this last figure presents great difficulties. The most easily executed polyhedron is 1 hexahedron; so in this case it would be necessary to reserve the six-sided division for the last.

**** Stars without envelopes.

  To complete a cabinet, we are often curious to separate each of the stars that we have made in polyhedra, or in balls.

  The best way to perform these pieces shown in fig. 2, 4, 6, 8 and 18, PI. 20, is to take them, usually, in a spherical envelope, which will be broken afterwards; but this envelope being destined to be destroyed, we will only take care of it to divide it exactly, and to mark the points of center which must determine the top of the points of the star.

  Moreover, we can make the openings much wider to introduce the hooks more easily, and we will pay all our attention to the star, which we will usually end with the plugs and in the ring mandrel, of which the use combines all the advantages.

  We will therefore not stop to describe all these operations, but we will only say a word about the star with thirty-two points, whose outline presents some peculiarities.

**** Thirty-two pointed star.

  It is a principle of geometry, which can only be found in a sphere with five regular bodies. So the thirty-two pointed star, which we are talking about here, cannot be regular, and it is only a curious object and rather difficult to execute, which will not spoil an Amateur's cabinet.

  The tracing of this star does not present any kind of difficulty. It’s on the icosahedron. The twenty centers of this polyhedron give twenty points; the other twelve are caught in the twelve Angloids. It is quite true, as we have just said, that the intercalation of these new points disturbs the regularity of the piece, since if the first twenty points are equidistant from each other, the other twelve are not; however, when the play is finished, you will only notice it if you pay some attention to it.

  The means for performing this piece differ little from the previous ones.
  We will put the ball in a ring mandrel, and we will make the points one after the other; but these points are so close together that it is impossible to keep an envelope, which moreover would be

---
Page 175 CHAP. V. Sect. IV- Stars in the five Polyhedra.

  perfectly useless; because the multiplied points of this star present enough solidity to maintain it in a mandrel, especially if one has the precaution to move on each point, as it is completed, a small stopper pierced with a conical hole, and a little larger than the end of the point.

  To save as much as possible the irregularity resulting from the twelve points added to those of the icosahedron, it is necessary to start by first performing the latter as regularly as possible, then we do the other twelve placed on the twelve angloids, and we adjust them as best as possible, so that this inequality is less visible to the eye.

  We will place this star in fig. 10, Pl. 20, on a pedestal like the others, by inserting a pin in one of the points, by means of a hole made in the cough, with a suitable drill, when it is at the center, and before it is at its size.

**** Nine-screw chuck.

  In the first edition of this Work, the Author, after having indicated succqin ^ held the means which we have just developed for executing the stars isolated, or enclosed in envelopes, taught another which involved very long details, and which it was almost impossible to execute.

  We thought we could dispense with recalling it here, being convinced, after several reiterated experiments, that the first means that we have just given was the only one that could be put to use with success, and that, on the contrary, the other Almost always exposed an Amateur to see a part which had cost him a long and painful labor to break when he believed to see it finished.

  However, we did not think it necessary to delete the figure or the description of the nine-screw chuck used in this operation, since this chuck can be usedin other circumstances, and besides that its construction does not contain some details.

  We will begin by making two mandrels, like the one represented in fig.11, Pl. 20, in profile and cut on its axis; and from the front, fig. 12. It shows the nut by means of which it mounts to the nose of the shaft. He must enter it just, without forcing or tossing. Whatever the diameter, we must reduce it from behind to the diameter of the base of the shaft, in order to make a line serving as a mark, with a similar one which is on this base.

---
Page 176 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 20 and 21

  If the ball to be placed in it is to be two inches in diameter 'we will give it three, at least, in front, when it is finished, to hollow it out splierically. We will make on the Lathe a gauge of very thin wood, two and a quarter inches in diameter, and we will hollow out the mandrel, so that this gauge enters it six lines more before the diameter, which will have been marked by a trait.

  We will drill at the bottom, and well in the center, a hole that communicates with the nut. We will form a nut there, not thinner than large. We will insert a screw cap b, made separately on another mandrel. This plug should exceed three to four lines internally, and not on the nose side of the tree, lest, resting on it, it will prevent the mandrel from approaching against the socket. Behind this plug, we will make two holes, to make it protrude and move back to the side of the nut a, using pointed round pliers. We make, with great care, in the center of the stopper, through the mandrel, a hole five to six lines deep, two lines or so in diameter, and conical, and above all perfectly centered.

  Six lines from the edge of this mandrel, we will draw on the circumference a circular line, which will be divided into nine parts, by means of a n flivisor, if there is one, on the shaft of the Lathe, otherwise with a compass. We will make as many holes, four lines and a half in diameter, and we will tap them with the tap of the wood die, six lines.

  We will turn nine screws, having fifteen to eighteen tapping lines, the head of which is a slightly flattened spheroid, or, as the workers say, in the shape of an onion: we see the shape, fig. 9 and 10, PI. 2 1; when the head will no longer hold to the mandrel except by a bearing of five to six lines in diameter, and which will be terminated by the end in a drop of tallow, it will be separated from the mandrel. When we have done them all, we will put a mandrel in the Lathe, which we will tap in the center, at the same pitch, and to the depth of the screws. We will put them there, one after the other, to finish and polish the head, and immediately, putting the mandrel in the vice, vertically, we will give two lines of cut, j £ g. 9, to make the head flat, and finally, the saw cuts will be repaired with skins.

  Figs. 11 and 12, PdlI. 20, where these screws are only three in number, indicate 'that at the end of each is a point; but for now we don't have to worry about it.

  The screws made with the most care, are seldom tapped concentrically to their axis. We often see a side where the threads are

---
Page 177 CHAP. V- Sect. IV. Stars in the Five Polyhedra.

  very high-pitched, while on the other they are flattened; and the steps are not all around the same depth. This defect does not, however, prevent these screws from being used for common uses; but in delicate works, where great regularity is needed, and the screw turns concentrically to its axis, it is advisable to have more perfect ones. Here's how we'll get it.

  We will turn a wooden cylinder four and a half inches long, in the interior of which we will make a nut to mount it on the step of the back of the shaft, as we taught in the first volume when talking about the sleeves. in copper; the cylinder will be reduced to about three inches in length to the diameter of the die guide for which the pitch is to be obtained. We will make its end conical, and we will thread it with the die in its entire length.

  We will then tap a small plank of good wood, ten to twelve lines thick. A fork will be made there as if it were a wedge, and it will be placed behind the Lathe, in the doll shown in fig. 11, PL 23, T.I, at the height of the center of the tree; and care will be taken to soap the screw, and lower the stop key.

  In this state one can, with a suitable comb, obtain a screw of the same pitch; and which, being threaded on the Tour, cannot fail to be perfectly round, both on the outside and in the depths. We can easily see that we can do by the same method, all the steps of the sectors with which 011 is matched. One can also use for this purpose the guns or copper sleeves which mount on the back of the tree and which we spoke about in the first volume.

  These screws will be made of boxwood, good wild apple, corm or other binding wood that can withstand the effect of combing.e without splitting, and we will provide ourselves with a certain quantity of screws of the same kind, but in the axis of several of which we will make a hole of one line in diameter, seven to eight deep. Small pieces of steel wire of the same size will be put on sides; they will be made to enter there with a little force; only one good line is left to exceed, and after cutting them with a file, point them conically, so that the point turns well in the center.

  Although all the holes drilled on the inner circumference of the mandrel have been tapped with the same instrument; it is difficult to see that there is not some slight difference between them. It is therefore appropriate when making each screw to present it several times to the same hole, and when

---
Page 178 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.20

  they will all be finished, they will be numbered so as not to change them.

  On inspection of Figs. 11 and 12, we can see the shape, length and diameter to be given to the mandrel. As the work to be done there is extremely delicate, and the shorter the mandrel, the less the part grazes under the tool, it is necessary, as much as possible, to reduce its length. This will be achieved easily, if the shaft of the Tour that we have is drilled, which is infinitely convenient, in several circumstances, which we will discuss below; so instead of putting the plug in the bottom of the mandrel, you can put it in the hole in the shaft. This resource is very advantageous, in that, in order to turn this stopper, and make the hole in it, either round or conical, the support can be approached against it, instead that, when it is at the bottom of the mandrel, the tool resting on the support, always has a resistance lever of nearly two inches, and that, if it is not very long on the side of the handle, the effort or power lever is too balanced by that of resistance , from where it follows that one is not sure to turn perfectly round.

**** Means of repairing a broken tip.

  Whatever care one takes in the operations just described is too ordinary, especially in sliced ​​wood, and when a star is at its end, an unforeseen blow breaks a point you are working on. It would be hopeless if the part were scrapped for that. Here is how you can bring back a point in place of the one that has been broken.

  The remaining portion will be whisked away with the chisel, up to the level of the face of the polyhedron at the bottom, if it was finished; and if it was not, we would finish it, using the gauge which determines the distance between the two polyhedra.

  We will mark in the center of this face with a barley grain, a point of center, deep of a line or a line and a half, and with a tool of very-narrow side, we will widen this hole, and we will do it. well cylindrical to the bottom, giving it for diameter one line less than at the base of the star.

  We will remove the chuck from the Lathe, after having spotted it on the base of the shaft. We will make with another mandrel, a cylinder a little bigger than the base of the point that we want to bring back. We will make a tenon at the end of

Pl.20

  length and size sufficient to fit just into the hole in the face of the inner polyhedron. We will draw it up well on its shoulder, and we will cut it a little shorter than the hole is deep. We will try it in its place; when it enters without forcing, we will cut it to the length of the point and a little more, after starting to give it the conical shape, so as not to have too much wood to carry when it is in place. We heat up some good glue, put a drop of it in the bottom of the hole, and lightly coat the circumference of the post with it, after which we will put it in its place, and we will push it with a little force against its shoulder. Take care that the glue does not bleed on the outside, as it alters the color of the wood, and makes the junction of the point sensitive;

  If this operation is done well, only trained people can see it, unlike the threads of the wood. It will be masked even better by making the attached wooden point, the thread of which is in the same direction as the broken point. When the glue is quite dry, we will finish this point, and by sparing a little the effort of the tool, we will put it to the suitable length and size, with the caliber with fork, and that with shoulder, whose end must lay against the face of the inner polyhedron.

  The means we have just given can repair accidents to a certain extent; but we must not hide from enthusiasts that a part thus repaired loses much of its merit, so we advise them to be patient and rather repeat their operation until they are successful.

*** SECTION V. Star detached in a ball enclosed in a cube pierced with a single opening.
Pl. 22

  The stars that we have just described in the previous sections are not the only pieces of this kind that can be performed on the Tour. A skilful and intelligent Amateur will be able to find a way to build many others, varying with taste their shapes and their combinations, as has been done with success in the pieces that we will detail in this section and in the following ones. , and which have not yet been described anywhere.

Page 180 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 22

  The first, fig. 1, is a cube pierced with a single telescope, in the interior of which a ball composed of three spherical envelopes has been detached, and pierced with twelve equal openings, and spaced according to the division into twelve, demonstrated in one of the previous sections. In the center of the ball we have reserved a small solid with twelve faces on each of which rises a star ray whose tip comes flush with the surface of the outer shell.

  As this part requires, like most of the previous ones, the use of a few special tools, and made on purpose, it is necessary to draw above all a drawing which represents the cut, as can be seen, fig. 2.

  Here is how to make this route.

  We will start by leading two undefined lines ab, cd, which intersect at right angles. From their meeting point, as the center, and with a compass opening equal to the radius that we want to give to the outer envelope, we will describe a circle e. Then, enlarging the opening of the compass by about a line, and without changing the center, we will make a second circle f concentric to the first, and indicating the shape of the interior surface of the cube, after the ball has been detached from it, with tools whose shape and thickness are determined by the interval between these two circles.

  From point l, where the undefined line a b intersects the circumference of the inner circle, we will bring to the right and to the left on the outer circle, at A and g, an opening of the compass a little less than the radius of the first circle; and through these two points we will lead an undefined straight line parallel to cd. We will then lead two lines k m, in, parallel to ah; and a third n m, parallel to c d, which with the line g h, will form a parallelogram indicating the side faces of the cube, after the ball is detached from it. By extending the lines Te m, in, and joining them together by the dotted line ik, we will have the shape that the cube must present on the outside, and before we start to dig the inside; the faces should be about three lines from the circumference of the outer circle for convenience.

  The solid reserved in the center of the ball, and which carries the rays of the star, is a dodecahedron of which we see in O the cut which is drawn as follows.

  We will describe a circle concentric with the first two, and which has for diameter the third of that of the inner circle. We will divide the circumference into ten equal parts, starting from the place where it is cut by

---
Page 181 CHAP. V. Sect. V. Star in a Cube, etc.

  line a b. We will join two by two the neighboring dividing points of the line a b, by parallels to c d. The same will be done at neighboring points, and the result will be the irregular hexagon shown in the figure, four sides of which subtend arcs of 72 degrees; the other two sides are equal to the sides of the regular decagon, and therefore subtend arcs of 3 G degrees.

  This figure represents a dodecahedron cut by a plane perpendicular to one of its faces, and passing through the center. In this position; we can only see in full, the four rays resting on the long sides, of which we can make the base more or less narrow at will, by conforming to the rules established above. The other two rays can only be seen foreshortened, and their layout being of no use, we thought we had to remove them to avoid confusion.

  The glasses in the middle of which pass the points of the star, must have for diameter, the eighth of the circumference of the swell; therefore to mark them on the cut, we will wear on the right and left of the points of the star, a compass opening equal to one sixteenth of the circumference.

  It is in the space reserved between two of these openings that we will describe six distant arcs of a circle as seen in the figure. The space left blank indicates the distance that must exist between the envelopes whose thickness is given by the space covered with hatching.

  Those of our readers who know mathematics, will perhaps find that we have extended ourselves a little too much on the outline of this figure; but those who have not studied this science, need all these details, since the slightest inaccuracy would make it nearly impossible to perform this part.e, for which it is now necessary to prepare the suitable tools.

  The first, the use of which is to detach the ball in its cubic envelope, are three in number and in the shape of the one in fig. 5. The beak of the smallest will have for length the ninth of the circumference of the circle e; the second, two ninths, and the largest, one-third of the same circumference. The dotted lines b, c, indicate the length of each of these tools.

  These tools, as has been said elsewhere, cut only from the end, but it is very essential that the concave part which serves as a guide be very exactly traced on the circumference of the inner circle, otherwise only a shapeless mass, and we will take care to reduce their

---
Page 182 TURNER'S MANUAL.

  thickness in proportion to their length, that is, the longer they are, the thinner they should be.

  We will soak the beaks along their entire length with great care, and we will return them to the color blue, otherwise they will break too easily. This is why we recommend making them from German steel, and preferably using foil blades.

  We will then make three other hooks similar to the previous ones, and intended to detach the inner envelopes of the ball. Their thickness is determined as we have just said, by the intervals left blank in the drawing.

  Finally, a tool must still be prepared, fig. 3, which serves to fix in a precise manner the place where each of these last three hooks must be introduced: the three cutters c, c, c, form three hollowed circles in the material. of about half a line, which facilitate the entry of the hooks, and at the same time round the edges of the three envelopes. The heel a comes to press on the outer surface of the ball, and thus gives the greatest precision to the results obtained by this tool.

  After having prepared all these tools, which we always recommend to sharpen with the greatest care to make them very tasty without altering their shapes, we will choose a piece of very healthy, very dry Spanish boxwood, and especially of thread and point knotty, large enough to be able to find the parailèlipipède i the mngfig. 2, and without worrying about its external shape, one will raise with the rasp a key faces, on the wood grain, by which one will stick it on a mandrel of same diameter.

  When it will be very dry, we will draw up with care and with ordinary tools the anterior face in the center of which we will draw a circle having for diameter the line g, - h, that is to say the string which underlies a little less than a third of the circumference of one of the large circles of the ball. All the material outside this circle will be lowered by about one line, after which we will round off the kind of tenon reserved in the center of the face, to form a spherical cap which exceeds the face of the cube. To work with regularity, we will have a gauge fig.4, taken from fig.2, which determines with precision, the shape of this cap, and at the same time that of the rest of the face. If we were satisfied with the eye, it would be very difficult not to deviate somewhat from the stroke, and the slightest irregularity would undoubtedly prevent the success of the operations which we are about to describe.

  The first is to detach the rest of the ball inside the

---
Page 183 CHAP. V. sect. V. Star in a Cube, etc.

  cube, which is done, as we know, with the three hooks prepared for this purpose; but before making use of it, we will approach the support as much as possible, and we will make in the wedge, which must be of good wood, very firm, and perfectly erect, a notch on the side where it is in front of the room, in order to which in closer approach.

  Then we will first introduce the shortest of the three hooks, pressing the concave side on the already rounded part of the ball which will serve as a guide; This is why great care will be taken not to engage the cutting edge of the tool until it touches the circumference at all its points, and especially the heel. We strongly recommend to amateurs who will undertake this piece, to take only a little wood at a time, and we advise them to turn with the wheel rather than with the pole, to avoid the jerks which could easily break such fragile tools. .

  When the first hook has produced the expected effect, it will be replaced successively by the second and by the third, redoubling the precaution, because we easily feel that, the longer the beak, the more accidents are to be feared. . To avoid some of it, we would do well to fix a copper plate, similar to that of the tool, to the body of the tool, fig. 15 PI. 21; but this is not intended to serve as a guide, it is unnecessary for it to be rounded: its use is to make it easier for the artist to hold the tool on the wedge of the support, and prevent it to change direction.

  After the passage of these three hooks, the ball must be entirely formed and detached, except on the inner side of the face of the cube opposite the bezel, to which it is still fixed by a small tenon placed at the point of rotation, and whose diameter is equal twice the thickness of the tool body. We tried in vain to destroy this tiny stud with very fine tools. We couldn't get them to bite, and we determined to break it, as we'll say.

  With the cube still on the lathe, and the ball fixed by means of the tenon, we will start by digging a conical opening, reserving the radius of the star in the center. Bring this hole approximately to the depth and diameter indicated by the drawing, after which we will make a hardwood cylinder about six inches long, the end of which will be conical and similar to the inside of the bezel. that we have just opened in the ball. We will dig in the center, and on the same side, a conical hole in which we will insert the point of the star, as when we place the corks we talked about in the previous sections. The excess part of the

Page 184 TURNERS MANUAL,
Pl. 22

cylinder provides a strong enough lever, so that one can, with its help, break the tenon which still retains the ball at the bottom of the cavity.

  Care must be taken to tilt the lever in the direction of the grain of the wood, otherwise the wood will not break clean, and the surface of the ball could be significantly damaged.

  The ball being free, we will remove the lever, we will bring the pole where the tenon was located opposite the telescope, in order to see the portion of material which has remained attached to the surface of the ball, and to judge by there of that which still holds at the bottom of the cavity, which one will plan easily, by introducing the longest of the three hooks there.

  Now it's time to divide the surface of the ball, and mark the center of the twelve glasses there. One of these centers is determined by the tip of the radius already outlined, and another by the center of the destroyed post; but the ten others are rather difficult to find, because the cubic envelope prevents to draw the semicircles with the help of which one determines them, and to introduce the compass there to space them equally. There is therefore no other way than to turn another ball of the same diameter as this one, and to trace on its surface twelve equally spaced circles, the diameter of the glasses. This division will then be transferred to the real ball by the following procedures.

  We will measure with a compass, the distance which is between the center of one of these circles and that of one of those which adjoin it, and placing one of the points of the compass, open at this distance, on the point of the ray already sketched, the other will necessarily fall on the center of one of the five neighboring glasses. From these two points, and always with the same opening of the compass, we will draw two arcs of circles which will intersect, and indicate by their section, the center of a third telescope placed in the hemisphere which contains the sketched telescope. By repeating the same operation, starting from these last two points, we will find a fourth placed in the other hemisphere. Using this, and one of the other two, we will determine a fifth, and if we repeat the operation again starting from these last two, we will infallibly arrive at the center of the destroyed post. If there was any slight irregularity, which is very difficult to avoid in such a tricky operation, we would start the difference over the six remaining points, so that it would become almost imperceptible. These last six points will be determined like the others; after which we will draw around all of them a circle the diameter of the aperture of the glasses. So we'll take care of breaking through

  the glasses, to hollow out the ball, reserving at its center, the dodecahedron which carries the twelve rays of 1 star; finally, to detach in the thickness of the ball, two spherical envelopes, in addition to the one that encloses the whole.

  These operations are carried out, as we have indicated when speaking of the ball, fig. 20, PI. 21, and with similar tools, but drawn on the drawing itself. We will therefore not repeat what we have already said on this subject; but we are going to explain in some detail the means that must be employed to place successively at the center of rotation the twelve points indicating the centers of the twelve spectacles, and to hold the ball during the operation.

  We will begin by gluing on the front face of the cube a ring of boxwood, about a line and a half high, and the front face of which will be carefully erected, so that its height is quite equal everywhere. In this position, it will be turned internally to the exact diameter of the bezel, of which it must form a sort of extension. We'll put it on the rond from outside, and we will practice on the same side a little fine thread.

  Then we will cut down the interior angle, to give the ring inside the shape of a truncated cone, the base of which is near the start of the thread, and the top at the place which touches the edge of the telescope, which must be taken care not to cut.

  Fig. 6 represents the section of the cube, on which this ring a a is glued.

  We will then make a nut, the cut of which can be seen in fig. 7, which fits on this ring, by means of the internal thread a a. Part b b fits very closely into the bezel, touches the ball by its end, and presses it against the bottom of the cavity as the nut is tightened on the ring. But first, you have to put the center of the telescope on which you want to work exactly in the center of rotation; and as it would be difficult to judge by eye when this has been achieved, we recommend presenting a steel punch with a point fine enough to enter the compass hole which indicates this center. In this situation, if we set the lathe in motion, the slightest eccentricity will produce a noticeable effect, and this will be easily remedied by turning the ball slightly on itself, using the needle. At the same time, the nut will be tightened, gently and repeatedly, until the point is perfectly at the center of rotation.

  So we will operate successively on the twelve glasses by the professionals

processes, and with the tools we have described; but the thickness of the ring and the nut, moving the shim away from the support, from the bezel of the ball, the tool, being too isolated, could easily engage and destroy by breaking the already finished parts . This accident can be prevented by placing the wedge of the support so that it has a nose which enters the cavity formed by the nut and by the ring glued to the face of the cube, and thus supports the tool closer to the part he starts.

  All these preparations require time and patience, and it would be very painful to see them rendered useless by some small defect in the conformation of a tool, which, then deviating from the route which it must follow, would destroy everything. which was done either by puncturing one of the envelopes, or by altering the regularity of the rays, or in any other manner. We will therefore urge the Amateurs to try them on the ball which was used to divide the surface. In this way we will easily see the irregularities which may exist in their shape, and we will repair them carefully before introducing them into the real ball.

  As it is very essential that all the rays of the star be perfectly regular and equal to each other, we will terminate them with a kind of caliber, fig. 8, of which the interior side ab must cut as well as the end, with which the face of the interior polyhedron which bears the base of the radius is partly erected, while the part ab completes giving the rest the shape it should have.

  Finally, the stoppers which are placed in the spectacles, as they are completed, as we have said elsewhere, present a difficulty which one does not experience in the execution of similar pieces, but of a greater degree. diameter: as, because of their shallow depth, the glasses are extremely conical, the buckles are not held there securely, and escape easily, unless a small cylindrical bearing is made towards their point, at the just diameter of the opening of the spherical envelope closest to the center. We see, fig. 9, the shape of one of these plugs; a a is the small staff we just talked about.

  We believe we can assure our Readers that if they do not neglect any of the precautions that we have detailed in this article, and if they operate with the skill and lightness essential in the execution of such delicate pieces, they will come. at the end of detaching the box, hollowing it out, forming the star and its twelve rays, and separating the three

spherical envelopes with a truly remarkable regularity, which constitutes the merit of pieces of this genre.

  To complete this, all that remains is to draw up and polish the five solid faces of the hexahedron in which the ball is contained: we will leave them as thick as we want; a line is sufficient at the thinnest places which are in the center of the faces.

*** SECTION VI. Tapered stars.

  Fig. 10 represents a star with twelve rays: each of these rays has its base resting on a pentagon, and retains this shape throughout its length.

  At first glance it is difficult to understand how the five-sided pyramids formed by these rays were created using the Tour. However, in the remainder of this section, we will see that there are several ways to achieve this.

  Whichever one you use, you should start by usually turning a ball, piercing twelve glasses on its surface, and forming in its interior a star with twelve rays, and having a dodecahedron as its nucleus. Although the envelope of this star is destined to be destroyed, it must however be turned outwards with care, so that it is perfectly spherical. Without this, it would not be possible to divide it exactly, and the slightest irregularity in the position of the points of the rays of the star, which, as we know, come to end at the twelve points of division, forming the centers of the glasses, would render very difficult the following operations.

  The star being entirely finished, we will break the envelope, and we will use, to put the five-sided rays, one of the following means.

  The first consists in putting the star on the Lathe, by grasping it so that one of its rays is presented at the point of rotation, and that the five adjacent ones are entirely free and out of the mandrel, as we see it. in fig. 11: this mandrel is similar to the split and ring mandrel, described on page. 280, and represented in fig. 8, PI. 23, of the first volume. To fix the star firmly there, and without damaging the tips, we will first surround 1 with a ring, seen in section at a, a,

  fig. 11, and composed of two semicircles, internally forming two inclined planes, which seize the star on the line corresponding to the equator of the ball, in which it has been detached, assuming the poles at the end of the rays which are currently at the center of rotation.

  This ring is made in the following way. First, turn a boxwood cylinder, of a height proportional to the distance between the points of the star. As for its diameter, it suffices that it can be conveniently grasped in a square span, made with the split mandrel that we use. It will then be sawn in half on its diameter; we will place it in this state in the ring mandrel, and we will make in its center a cylindrical opening to the diameter of the core of the star. Then the inside corner will be chamfered down to the middle of the height; after which we will return the ring to the mandrel, to do the same on the other side. During this operation, the mandrel will be loosened from time to time, and the two parts of the ring will be removed, to check whether the two inclined planes, which are practiced inside, coincide well with the inclination of the spokes of the 'star.

  The ring being thus finished, we will grasp the star by the middle, as seen in the figure at a, a, and we will place it thus surrounded by the ring in the square span of the mandrel, which we will tighten lightly with the ring C, C. Then we will draw up the five rays, which present themselves, by cutting down the fifth part of their circumference. We will first use a barley grain, going from the point to the center, and we will finish joining them with a very fond, narrow and sharp chisel. When this operation has been repeated twelve times, putting the twelve points one after the other in the center of rotation, each ray will form a pyramid with five faces, and the star with sides will be finished.

  The method which we have just described requires a very practiced hand; because if the position of the tool were to vary even a little during the operation, the points of the star would soon be broken, or at least damaged.

  This consideration has determined us to try to find a less difficult method of achieving the same end, and which therefore suits a greater number of our Readers; and we did this with the front view milling cutter, fig. 12, and an a ,, a cut in the chuck fig. i 3.

  This cutter is pierced at its center with a cylindrical hole the diameter of the base of the star's rays, and its outer face, which is cut,

Page 189 CHAP. V. Sect. VI. Tapered stars.

  as seen in the figure, is slightly inclined, going down from the center to the circumference, as indicated by the section a, a, fig, 1 3. It is mounted on the Lathe in the air within the reach of an ordinary wood chuck, in the center of which is a hole about an inch deep and the same diameter as that of the milling cutter it extends exactly.

  At the bottom of this hole is placed a coil spring c /, on which the cylinder c is placed, pierced on its front face with a conical hole, indicated in the figure by pitted lines, of the same shape, but a little more short that lthe rays of the star; and so that the point does not run the risk of damaging itself, a cylindrical and very fine hole is drilled at the bottom with a drill.

  The cutter being placed in the mandrel and assembled on the Lathe, it is a question of presenting the star there, by making enter one of its rays in the hole of the cylinder cy but as it would not be easy to hold it with the hand, motionless and well in the center, while the cutter is driven by the movement of the Lathe, we have employed the following means to make up for it.

  O11 will turn a boxwood plug, fig. i4, about two inches of binder, and drilled in its center with a conical hole, similar to that of cylinder c. We will draw up its anterior face, and we will make five notches inclined and spaced like the five rays of the star which surround the one which is placed in the conical hole.

  At the other end, we will make a square staff d, on which we will insert the square hole of a left turn.

  After these arrangements we will place one of the rays of the star in the hole of the bur, and the one that is diametrically opposite to it in the hole of the stopper. The five spokes which accompany the first rest on the cutters of the cutter, and the five others enter the notches made on the face of the stopper as seen in fig. 1 5. We will approach the doll which carries the screw point, behind the stopper, and we will fix it there; after which the screw will be tightened, until the point which touches the stopper from behind makes the star lightly press against the bur.

  In this state we will set the Lathe in motion, by holding the left-hand spinner with the left hand, which will keep the star motionless while the turning cutter will raise the face of the five spokes cpii placed on it; as the material is started, we will push to cut, tightening the screw of the point; the pressure exerted by the coil spring d always maintains the radius which is at the center of rotation in the axis of the Lathe,

, and prevents it from deviating by the effect of the resistance that the material • 22 * ​​opposes to the cutters of the strawberry.

  When we judge to the eye that the fifth part of the circumference of the spokes is close to being cut, we will withdraw the point back to remove the star and put another spoke in the center of the cutter, which is repeat twelve times to form five panels on each of the twelve spokes. These sections, from what we have just said, are still only sketched out, and to finish them, we will once again present all the sections, one after the other, with a strawberry. During this second operation, we will accelerate the movement of the Tour, and we will take very little material at a time, to make the points of the very sharp spokes, to make the sides perfectly equal, and their angles very sharp, which constitutes the main merit of these kinds of pieces.

  Before ending this article, we will add that, if we had a report point on the point headstock, fig. 11, PL 24? T- Ii, the point A of which is mounted by means of a screw h in a nut made inside the threaded rod, it would be easier to do with the stopper fig. i 4, instead of the square face of a screw thread, by means of which it would be mounted in the nut which receives the gear point.

  After having succeeded in flanking an isolated star, it was natural to seek means of making a similar one enclosed in a spherical envelope. This piece presents rather great difficulties; however, by following exactly the walk that we are going to describe, we have managed to perform it consistently.

  The first thing you need to do to operate safely and accurately is to make a single line drawing of the cut of the part. The layout is the same as that of fig. 2, which we have fully described in the previous section, however removing the outer parallelogram ik mn, the line g, h, and the arcs of a circle indicating the thickness and the distance from the envelopes.

  After having made this drawing, we will turn a ball to the diameter of the largest circle, and we will mark on its surface twelve equally spaced points, around each of which we will make twelve small circles having for diameter the eighth of the circumference.

  These small circles indicate the place and the width of the twelve glasses, which one will begin by hollowing out all parallel to the axis and to the depth of approximately one line, that is to say of the thickness that one wants. give 1 envelope. In the center of the flat surface that lies at the bottom of these

Page 191 CHAP. V. Sect. VII. Tapered stars.

  twelve hollows, we will mark a dot in ink, and clearly visible, after which we will continue to dig, in the same direction, the one that appears in front, reserving a tenon in the center to form one of the spokes and we will bring this hole at the depth indicated © by the drawing. When we get there, we'll take a tool from the forme of those fig.14, PL 23, with which we will form around the base of the spoke an inclined plane from the points marked at the center of the five glasses adjacent to that which is at the center of rotation; the tool, rounding the inside of the casing, will uncover nearly half of these bezels, and the dots marked will prevent them from being opened more than necessary.

  Then we will make the radius conical over its entire length, leaving it a little more diameter than the drawing indicates; a stopper will be placed over it, the end of which must touch the inclined plane of the bottom at all its points; and stick it to the hole in the bezel. Fig. iG represents the result of this first operation. The lines O b, and O a, indicate the direction of the inclined plane. A is the cork, which we have represented near its place, so that we can better distinguish its shape.

  The operations which we have just described will be repeated exactly on the bezel diametrically opposite to it; and after allowing the glue to dry, we will move on to the other ten glasses, always putting forward, one after the other, those that are at the ends of the same diameter; but with regard to the last ten, it should be observed that the rays placed at their center each have a face formed by the effect of the inclined planes which surround the base of the first two rays.

  The number of these faces increases as the number of hollow glasses increases, so that the twelfth ray is entirely finished, and five-sided, when it is placed in the center; and all that remains is to form the inclined plane that surrounds its base.

  It is easy to understand that the plugs placed on the first finished points are reached by the tool; that's why they have to be glued to the hole, otherwise they will spin and fall soon.

  We will then destroy the part of the caps, stuck on the openings of the glasses that we will clean, and on the edges of which we will form, if desired, a few moldings.

  We can make this room even more pleasant, by practicing a double spherical envelope. In this case, it is necessary to leave by operating more thickness to the envelope, and to divide it in two when the star is entirely finished.

Page I92 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 22.
*** SECTION VII Star with reversed points.

  We will give in this section the description of a piece of a rather singular shape, and which produces a very pleasant effect. This part, of which fig. 17 represents the section, consists of a ball ", enclosed in a spherical envelope pierced with twelve holes, in the center of which it is fixed by twenty spokes, the base of which rests against the interior surface of the envelope. .

  If you want to perform this piece with any regularity, you have to make a pattern that presents no difficulty, since it consists only of three concentric circles representing the cross section of the ball and its envelope. The space enclosed between the two larger ones is the thickness of the casing, which can be given about a line. With respect to the inner circle representing the ball, we will give it one-third of that in which it is immediately contained.

  After this preliminary tracing, 011 will turn a ball to the exact diameter of the outer circle, and one will trace on its surface twelve equally spaced circles, and to each of which one will give for diameter the eighth of the circumference.

  The ball thus divided will be placed in a hemispherical mandrel, to successively hollow out on each of the twelve circles a small cylindrical bearing area equal to the thickness determined for the envelope.

  Then we will continue to dig the one of these glasses which will be at the center of rotation, so as to make a cylindrical hole, the bottom of which will form a plane tangent to the pole of the ball, after which we will introduce a side tool, fig. i 4, PL 23, with which we make the interior surface of the envelope, spherical until the birth of the plane. By the effect of the passage of this tool, the glasses which are close to those of the pole are largely updated, since they were previously hollowed out to a depth equal to the thickness of the envelope, and it will therefore be easy to follow through these openings the course of the tool, fig. 18, which will then be introduced into the cavity. The concave part a is sharp, and formed on a quarter of the circumference of the inner circle of the design, and its end b is shaped like a barley kernel.
  We will start by starting the material with this point, by pressing

Pl. 22.

  until the heel lands, or is close to landing on the plane tangent to the pole of the ball; then we will push the tool to the right, until the line c d, which is only the extension of the heel, is precisely in the axis of the Lathe; at this point, we can imagine that in its revolution the tool will describe a hemisphere concentric with the envelope, and will therefore form half of the inner ball; but to achieve this, you have to keep the tool straight during all this work, and so that the line c d is in the direction of the axis of the lathe. Fig. 19 shows the cut of the part after the effect of this last tool. We will then turn the ball pole for pole in the mandrel, and repeating exactly the same operations, we will finish forming the inner ball, and detach it, after which we will remove; always with the same tool, the portion of material which still retains, the ball.

  If it happens that the ball was not exactly spherical, which can easily be done, either by some defect in the conformation of the tool, or by some deviation of the hand, it should be repaired as follows.

  A cylinder of boxwood, a little smaller than the glasses, will be turned in an ordinary mandrel, so that it can turn very freely. Give its anterior end the shape of a truncated cone, the top of which will be slightly hollowed out. We will fix the ball in this concavity with a glue fly, and when it is very dry, we will put it on the Lat to regularize the shapes, by inserting the suitable tools through the side glasses. At the end, we will destroy with a barley grain the conical part of the cylindrical stem, and we will at the same time regulate the portion of the ball which was retained there. This operation having necessarily reduced the diameter of the ball, it is necessary to measure the distance which is between its surface and the interior of the envelope, which is done with the help of a dancing master, and by placing the ball on one of the full intervals. Half of this interval gives the length of the rays, which are twenty in number, and in the form of small rather sharp cones. Great care must be taken in turning them to finish their points well, and to make them all perfectly equal and similar to each other.

  There are several ways to put them in place, as seen in the figure. The easiest way is to drill the envelope with twenty holes placed in the center of the triangles between the twelve large openings.

  It will be easy to introduce the rays through these small glasseses, and place them in the direction of the rays of the envelope. In this case it is necessary to have

---
Page 194 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 22.

  Take care, by turning them, to make them long enough to be able to form at the end a small collar followed by a base which will bear outwardly on the surface of the casing, and which can be given the shape of a rosette.

  The other way, presenting more difficulty, therefore increases the merit of the piece; it consists in placing the rays from the inside, so that the center of their base comes to rest on the point of the inner surface of the envelope corresponding to the centers of the twenty intermediate triangles of which we have just spoken. We introduce them successively through the glasses, holding them with small pliers called Brussels, and we bring them to their place, where we must have previously put a light fly of good glue.

  One might think that in this case it is necessary to give the base of the spokes a slightly convex shape, so that it can be applied by all its points on the inner surface of the envelope. However, we advise Amateurs to do nothing, and to make these bases exactly flat. By this means only the angle will touch the face of the casing, and a small cavity will form under the rest in which the glue will be lodged without making any burrs on the outside.

*** SECTION VIII. Make, in the center of several loose balls, a Snuffbox lined with tortoiseshell, and garnished with Circles also with tortoiseshell.
Pl.23.

  The details in which we entered on the manner of making stars, in the five regular bodies, could not be sufficient to indicate the means of taking in the center of a sphere all the parts which one desires; and to avoid our readers the gropings and trials which we ourselves have often been obliged to make, the obstacles which we have had to surmount, and which may disgust an Amateur, we are going to describe the manner of doing in the interior of 'a sphere one or more detached and concentric envelopes, with a box lined with tortoiseshell, and garnished with circles or braids also of tortoiseshell; and we will assume that we are working with a piece of boxwood, ivory, by its nature, being much easier to work.

  First, choose a perfectly dry piece of boxwood, without knots or cracks, whose pores are completely equal. If we can get

---
Page 195 CHAP. V. sect. VIII- Make the center of several balls, etc.

a very healthy and not chapped magnifying glass, when it is finished, it will offer more pleasing effects to the eye. We will carefully make a ball or sphere, the area of ​​which will be divided as if we wanted to draw a polyhedron; the hexahedron presenting less difficulty, we will use it in the following example, and we will assume that the ball we are operating on is two inches eight lines in diameter.

  We will put this sphere in a lathe, in a ring mandrel, and even, if we have a sure and practiced hand, we can be satisfied with a hemispherical mandrel. Care should be taken to place the ball so that the first telescope is in the upright wood, that is to say that the ball is entangled in the same direction in which we turned the cylinder where it was taken. O11 will dig a telescope ten lines deep, and one inch aperture, and somewhat tapered. To determine the thickness of the husks, give the inner part a cut of a cheek barley, similar to that in fig. 6, PL 21, but the point of which is at a sufficient distance from the cheek that you press. against the outside of the bezel.

  We've recommended giving the bezel an inch of opening, and since it should be a bit tapered, we'll assume that at its inner end it's only eleven. It is necessary, while hollowing out the telescope, to reserve on the core a tenon b, fig. 3, not perfectly cylindrical, but a little bigger at the bottom than on the edge, so that being placed in the mandrel, it can be inserted there. very fair, and serve to turn the box. This tenon will be given four lines in diameter, over four key lengths. We will then hollow out with the hook fig. 14, the curvature of which will be found by means of the circles drawn on paper like the one a, ", fig. 19, PL 21, which determine the thickness to be given to the envelopes. When we have detached a little more than half the distance that must exist between each bezel, we will make the opposite bezel; and by detaching the core all around this telescope, we will reserve a tenon similar to that which is opposite to it; we will then make the other four spectacles, and thus detach the nucleus; but these should only be hollowed out to the depth of the barley-grain cut traced on the first, and intended to indicate the thickness of the husks. When we will be on the sixth, we will go to the end in small strokes, with the hook, for fear of making a few splinters which harm the beauty of the work, since there is only wood just this. that it is necessary, and that it cannot be removed without reducing the diameter of the box.

  When we finish the last glasses, the core being almost no longer held, wobbles; the hook engages there, and can easily break. For

---
Page 196 TURNER'S MANUAL.

  to avoid these inconveniences, we will turn two stoppers, which, by entering a little tightly into the bezel, simultaneously receive the tenons that we have just made, which will retain the core and prevent all accidents.

  When the six glasses are finished, and the core completely cleared, it is necessary to make a mandrel, 20, of eleven lines of diameter, so that it can turn freely in the bezel, and of sufficient length so that the tenon reserved for the core can enter it completely, and the ball can turn freely.

  We will dig a span there indicated by the lines punctuated at A suitable to receive one of the tenons A, reserved for the core, fig. 2, which represents the section of the bowl separated from its cover, fig. 7, in which we see the other tenon B. In this state, we can see, on inspection of fig. 1, that the core being firmly locked in, can turn without dragging the ball, and that the telescope a, which is in front of the artist, allows that we introduce suitable tools. We will therefore introduce, through this telescope, by placing the support opposite, a tool with a bevel, and we will draw up the ncore on the upright timber, leaving it only long enough for the total height of the box and its cover, and in addition a line and a half for the passage of a donkey's lip which must separate one of the other. If more length was given, it could only be at the expense of the diameter of the box; and it is understood that the larger its diameter, the more difficult and surprising it is to have worked in such a small space.

  Then take a donkey's beak a good line wide, three or four thick, so that it does not flex, and we will separate the bowl from the cover, giving the latter less height than the bowl, as it should be for a snuffbox. The donkey's beak should be a little wider at the end than at the body, so that it does not engage in the line, at the risk of breaking everything.

  In this operation, and in all those where we will only work on the core, we do not have to worry about the envelope; the tool holds it sufficiently, and the core turns very freely.

  When the two parts are separated, we will fix the one, fig. 7, which must be the cover, against the bezel A, fig. 3, by means of a little wax, so that it does not toss, and that it is not likely to be broken; then, with a hooked tool, such as the one in fig. 8, which has three bevels, one in a, another in b, and the third in c, we will hollow out the box. If the distance between the bowl and the lid was not large enough to give no-

switching to this tool, we would start with the one, fig. 9, which has a shorter beak, and we would end with the other. In this operation, it is necessary to cut a little wood at a time, so as not to break anything; hold the tool perpendicular to the box, so that the bottom is at the same time well parallel to the outer surface, and perpendicular to the sides, being impossible to present any rule or square. We can use, in this operation, a kind of jew's harp, fig. 28, PI. i \, the cutting part of which must be the exact depth of the box. When the rod b b touches the edges, the tool will no longer bite, and the box will be hollowed out with all the accuracy and regularity that one may desire. As the tortoiseshell box must be lined, care should be taken to prepare the tortoise shell in advance, before determining the inside diameter, so that it fits right in.

  We will form with the tool, fig. 10, the place of the outer circles a, b, fig. 2, giving them a little more depth towards the inner corner, with the small barley kernel .fig. i 5, so that the circles set up, very fair, are less likely to come out. These two tortoiseshell circles will be turned with care; then, removing the cuvette from above the mandrel on which it is, we will make the circle enter through a bezel, softening it in hot water; and it will be made to enter a little force in its rabbet; then the part will be reassembled on its mandrel.

  If we know how to weld the scale, we will make a suitable sheet, both for height and diameter, and in this regard we refer to what we said in our first Volume. We will put it on a trihoulet to turn it, and we will put up the part that should rest against the back plate and contain it. Then we will put it back in a hollowed-out mandrel to turn and finish its interior part. The inside diameter of this mandrel exactly represents that of the bowl; we will therefore use it to make a copper gauge, fig. 29, PI. 21, with the help of which the inside of the box will be brought to the exact diameter it should have, so that the groove enters it without wobbling. We will also prepare the back plate, and when we have made sure that both are perfectly suited to the place they must occupy, we will remove the part from the Lathe, to put it in the vise by the mandrel. , and work more conveniently. We will soak the plate in hot water, to make it flexible, and, without wasting time, we will bend it enough so that it can pass through a side glass, and we will put it in its place, straightening it. with the fingers. This operation must be done with dexterity and promptness, so that

the plate, which is very thin, on cooling it does not retain its curved shape. In the same way, we will dip the stick in hot water, we will coat the inside of the bowl with glue, and pressing this stick between the fingers, we will make it enter through a glass, and we will put it in place.

  It is not enough to have these two pieces in place, you have to contain them, and prevent them as they dry out from disturbing and not being exactly applied. To achieve this, we will lower the part reserved for the cover down the throat, and hold it there with a small hand press.

  Let everything dry for a sufficient time. He will be strongt then easy to place the circles, or braids in a, b, fig. To; and when everything is dry, carefully turn the haste C, fig. n, and the whole thing will be brightened internally with a piece of angled wood, roughly the shape of the tool, fig. 8 and 9, and capable of passing through the telescope. We will garnish it with buffalo tied with good glue, at an acute angle, between b and c, fig. 8. We say at an acute angle, in order to penetrate more securely into the angle that the box forms with the bottom. Part b will polish the bottom, and part c will polish the mat, pulling the tool towards you. For this, we will use a fine pumice stone, with a little oil; then finish the polish with very fine tripoli, also in oil. Finally, with another tool also garnished with huffle and dry tripoli, we will give the shine to the entire interior of the box.

  We will remove the part from above its mandrel, and we will put in its place the piece of wood intended to make the cover to which 011 has reserved a tenon perfectly similar to the first. We will work it in the same way, securing the box against its bezel with wax. When the bottom, the small box and the circles are glued and dry, we will turn the box inside, well round, with the tool, y / g '. 9, and we will draw up the circle a, fig. 12, on the spot, so that it joins the basin. We will polish the whole inside, as we did with the bowl, and we will take care that the cover fits very just on the canister or groove C, fig. 11. The cuvette will then be attached to its cover by inserting the throat, and if the operation has been carried out correctly, it must be held there securely; the support will then be rotated, as seen in fig.1; and with suitable tools, remove all the wood that formed the tenon on the bowl. We will finish the underside, with a plane that goes imperceptibly towards the center, as befits a snuffbox. The support will be turned over again, and through the front bezel, the box will be erected perfectly to its height, and the four circles or stripes will be flush with; finally 011 will polish everything, so much

below than on the side, and the box will be almost complete; however, what remains for us to do to complete it does not fail to present some difficulties.

  We will make a mandrel similar to the one in fig. 20, the face of which is solid, and we will fix the box to it from below the bowl using mastic. We will center it and train it exactly, which is not very easy; but we will be able to judge, by watching the tenon of the cover turn, whether the part is straight and round on the Lathe.

  When we have achieved this, we will destroy the tenon, and we will finish the top, making it a little rounded. We can inlay in the center a fly, a small circle, an eccentric rosette, or any other ornament which serves to recognize the top when the box is closed; it will be polished with care, and the snuffbox will be finished.

  If the mastic had left some traces on the underside of the box, they would be erased properly, and the luster would be restored by the procedures we have indicated.

  Now you have to take care of detaching the two envelopes. The part will be placed in a hemispherical or ring mandrel, taking care that one of the bezels is perfectly centered in front, as seen, fig. 1. Then, with the tool, 14, the circular part of which is at the exact curvature of the inner circle ", a, fig. 3, and which cuts perfectly, we will unite the inside of this cavity, by successively placing in front of each of the six glasses. When it comes to the last, we will fix the box in its envelope, surrounding it with cotton to prevent it from tossing, which will damage it; then we will mark, with the tool, fig. i 5, the groove that should separate the two balls from each other. The shoulder b * pressing externally against the ball, the beak, or cutting edge a, must necessarily leave the space between a and b full, which gives the thickness of the first envelope; and this is a sure way to determine the thickness at each bezel. We will then successively introduce each of the hooks, fig. 4, 5 and 6, putting a stopper on each bezel, which contains the envelopes, to prevent fracture, and the envelopes will be detached.

  As this interior turns in the one above, and we can see its surface through the glasses, it is appropriate to make this surface as smooth as possible, and to erase the lines that the hooks may have left there. : for this, we will put in the center of a telescope one of the solid triangles formed by three of the glasses of the inner ball;

---
Page 200 TURNERS MANUAL,

and with small wedges, placed at the opposite bezel, between the two envelopes, the inner one will be fixed in this position. We will put the part in the hemispherical mandrel, and with horsetail, we will polish this part of the surface, whichpresents itself by this bezel. The other seven triangles and their neighboring parts will be polished in the same way, by presenting them successively to this telescope by the same means; and with patience, we will finish polishing the entire surface of the second envelope.

  There is shown, fig-16, a section of the two envelopes, and the box as a whole, with its cover and the tortoiseshell circles, in order to show the cavity of the second envelope, its thickness, the distance between it. and the first; finally the thickness that should be given to this first.

  In this state, the piece is entirely finished, if we are content to leave the surface of the first envelope smooth: but to increase the difficulties and the merit of the work, we have represented, fig. 17, the various moldings that we can do on its surface.

  First, around each bezel, we can make a frame, of which Fig. 17 shows the moldings and profiles. Between the six spectacles, are eight triangles, the protrusion of which is marked by a line of donkey's beak, half a line deep; and these triangles themselves can be decorated with different moldings, as shown in fig. 17. All the tools indicated for this purpose will be used for these moldings. Finally, we can, by placing the central point of each of the triangles at the center of rotation, form small glasses or rosettes, themselves decorated with frames. It’s the taste alone that should determine what is most pleasant.

  Instead of giving the outer envelope the shape of a ball, we can give it that of any polyhedron, like a dodecahedron, in which we will detach one or more spherical envelopes, in the center of which we will perform the snuffbox. by the same means. Then we must leave the faces of the polyhedron entirely flat and without any kind of ornament. This last shape appeals more to the eye, which can sometimes suspect deception in the moldings, as we said above when teaching to make stars in these polyhedra.

  If we wanted to further increase the merit of the difficulty overcome, we could, with a lot of patience, make a much larger number of balls, one inside the other: but then we would have to give them much less thickness and less thickness. distance between them. The way to operate

is always the same, only we will observe to start by detaching the smallest. The hooks having to be infinitely thin, we can imagine with what patience, what lightness of the hand, and what precision, all these operations would have to be carried out. We only need to have detailed the main ones; it is up to the Amateur to put into practice the concepts we have given, and to apply the principles on which they are based.

*** SECTION IX. Agrfaated balls.
Pl. 24.

  The stapled balls, shown in fig. i and 2, PL 24, are undoubtedly among the rare pieces which contribute the most to the ornament of an Amateur's cabinet; but their execution requires patience, a very practiced hand, and some special tools, which will be found in detail in the description that we are going to give of these parts and of the manner of making them, starting with fig. 1, which represents three balls stapled one in the other, and taken in a single piece of wood or ivory. This last material is, as we know, easier to work with, and if we want to use it in this circumstance, we must choose a piece taken in the middle of the tooth, and large enough so that after having removed the crust and cracks, there is enough left to give the balls a sufficient diameter. But, as we have said elsewhere, the main merit of these kinds of works consists in the difficulty overcome, and for this reason we advise to prefer the boxwood.

  We have executed the three stapled balls in fig. 1 with boxwood burl, and we will assume throughout the course of our description that it is on this material that the Amateur operates.

  It is absolutely essential to start by fixing on the paper the sketch of the cut of the part that you want to make, according to the dimensions and proportions that you propose to give it. This sketch consists only of the simple drawing of three circles, the centers of which are on the same straight line, and which intersect each other, as seen in fig. 4. These three circles should not be equal, but go decreasing, so that the diameter of the middle one is the average term between the other two; this way the piece is more pleasing to the eye, and easier to perform. Regarding the portion of each cir-

conference, which must be included in the neighboring circumference, we have recognized, after several experiments, that if one wishes to give to the holes by which the balls are mutually stapled more regularity, and more in agreement with the other openings made in the outside of the balls, it must be equal to two sevenths of the circumference.

  We choose a boxwood burl, very dry and very healthy, and the pores of which are very tight, which is easily recognized by the weight. We will rough it with an ax or a saw, and we will make a kind of cone of sufficient length and size, which we will pierce in addition, on its axis, first with a bit in the tongue. carp, and then with a ladle, to make the hole conical throughout its length.

  We will take an ordinary wooden mandrel, a little short, in the center of which we will hollow a span, to receive a rod that will be firmly glued to it, and to which we will give a conical shape, so that it can enter the hole of same shape, pierced in the center of the piece of boxwood just prepared.

  This done, we will thread the piece of boxwood, by its base, on the stem which must exceed it by a few lines, and we will divide it into three parts, from A to B, from B to C, from C to D, fig. .3.

  We will turn each of these three parts cyindrically, and we will thus have three cylinders placed one after the other, which we will reduce, the first on the side of the mandrel, to the diameter of the largest ball; the next, to the diameter of the second; and finally the last, to the diameter of the small ball.

  We will take the radius of the big ball from the drawing, and we will place it on the first cylinder, from A to F; from this point F to point G, we will take the distance between the center of the first ball and that of the second; finally from G to H, the interval which separates the center of the second ball from that of the last. By points F, G and H, we will draw on the circumference of the cylinders, circular lines in pencil, or rather in ink, so that they are more visible. These lines represent the equators of the three balls, whose axis lies in the common axis of the three cylinders.

  We will then begin to gouge the three partial cylinders in the form of a spherical portion, following exactly the line from which it is very essential not to deviate; because if we remove too much material in some place, we are in danger, in the following operations, of puncturing the ball or of making it irregular; which largely destroys its merit.

Page 203 CHAP. V. Sect. IX. Stapled balls.
Pl. 24.

  To prevent this accident, it is necessary to make a caliber fig. G, which is just a cut sheet of copper, following the outline of the outer portions of the circles that make up the cut of the piece. Using this caliber, and with sharp tools, you will absolutely finish the outside of the three balls, so that you do not need to go back there; which would be impracticable. It is especially at nip points that it is very important not tonot remove more material than necessary, and we will rather leave them a little oily so as not to risk anything.

  On these surfaces thus finished, we will trace the orifice of the holes or glasses that we must make there by spacing them as equally as possible, We say as equally as possible, because the shape of this part is opposed to what we can use any of the five regular divisions of the sphere.

  The division into twelve alone could, at a pinch, be put into use; but then the middle ball would be entirely enclosed in the other two, which would destroy all the coziness of the room.

  After several tries, we decided to drill fourteen holes on the surface of each ball; and to space them, if not equally, at least symmetrically, we have employed the means which we are going to describe, assuming that the Tower on which we are operating is furnished with a platform.

  We will begin by bringing the wedge of the support very close to the part, after having placed it very exactly level, and we will place the gauge on it, fig. G, so that it touches the circumference of the three balls. Then, having set the platform alidade on one of the numbers that can be divided by eight, we will draw a pencil line in the direction of the axis of the room, and which exactly follows its outer contours. We will lead seven other lines similar to this one, and equally spaced between them, each time skipping a sufficient number of points; twelve, for example, if the platform division carries ninety-six. These eight lines all pass through the poles of the first and third balls, and represent on the surface of the three balls four large circles, on the circumference of which are the centers of all the holes to be determined.

  For this we will take in the drawing an opening of a compass equal to the cord of 3 o degrees of the circumference of the large ball, and we will carry it on this ball at point c, where the equator is intersected by one of the eight lines which 'we have just drawn, at points L and M, taken on this line. We will repeat the same operation starting from the point of the equator, diametrically

Pl. 24.

  opposite to point c; and then, on the two points of the equator 90 degrees apart from those on which we have just operated, which, in our figure, are at the circumference. These eight points will give the centers of eight holes, placed on two large circles of the ball, perpendicular to the equator, and diametrically opposed to each other; and from the construction which we have just given, it is very easy to determine them by means of the Tour. Indeed, if, after having found by the operation described above the points L and M, 011 successively places the point of a very fine barley grain on these two points, one will draw two small circles parallel to the equator, which will intersect the great circle on which these two points JL JM are located, and the one which is perpendicular to it at the points sought. The four holes placed on the small circle M. are the ones through which this ball clips to the one in the middle.

  The centers of the holes N R, and those diametrically opposite them, and therefore not visible in the figure, are placed on the equator at the points where it is intersected by the other two large circles.

  Finally, the last two holes are at the two poles, and are drilled in advance, using the conical hole made at the start of the operation on the axis of the workpiece, and throughout its length.

  The small ball is divided by the same means and according to the same principles as the large one; as for the middle one, the lines which have guided us so far will still serve us now, with this difference, that instead of placing the points L, M, on the same line, we place them in P and in Q , on the neighboring line; this difference comes from the fact that, in order for the balls to be clamped, the intervals of one must be placed opposite the holes of the other; which results perfectly from the layout which we have just described.

  Some of our readers, little versed in geometry, might find themselves embarrassed to find without groping the chord of thirty degrees, that is to say of the twelfth part of the circumference. It is in their favor that we will provide the following means. An opening of the compass equal to the radius or half-diameter A C will be carried on the circumference, which will give the two points A JB, the distance of which is equal to the chord of one sixth of the circumference. From point A, with any compass opening greater than half of e. AB, we will draw an arc of a circle towards D, and with the same opening of the compass, we will repeat this operation by placing the point of the compass in B, then placing a rule on the center C, and on the point of intersection D} we will lead a

Pl. 24.
right who corpera the circumference at point E, also distant from points A and B. The distance A E, or its equal B E, will obviously be the chord of the twelfth part of the circumference.

  It is perhaps useful to observe that the same operation must be done on the three circles which represent the cut of the three balls, and whose diameter is not the same.

  After having thus placed the centers of all the holes, one will immediately trace their circumferences to the determined diameter, observing that those of each ball must be equal to each other, and proportionate to the size of the ball on which they are placed. We cannot give fixed rules in this regard, and we will just say that the smaller they are, the more difficult the piece will be to perform, and therefore the more merit it will have.

  However, this consequence should not be pushed too far, because these bezels must be equal to the orifices of the conical hole drilled on the axis of the part, and this one must have a certain dimension, in order to facilitate the introduction of the tools. we will use it to hollow out the inside of the three balls, reserving the portions of material by which they are stapled; it is this operation that we will describe.

  We will first remove the piece from the rod on which it is threaded, and we will mount it in a chuck of good wood hollowed out well round, and so as to grasp it on the side of the small ball, up to the equator of that of the middle, and to let exceed only half of this one, and the largest of which the orifice is at the center of rotation.

  It is through this orifice, which is nothing more than the end of the hole that crosses the entire room, that we will successively introduce the tools necessary to hollow out the inside of the large ball.

  The first is a hook in the form of that in fig. 14, PI- 2 t 3 of this Volume, which displaces a certain amount of material, and facilitates the insertion of the tool fig. 7. This enlarges the hole according to the shape it should have; after which we replace it with the one in fig. 8, the shape of which is the same, but of a larger dimension. The straight part i ?, and the curved part C, are cutting, and end with a round stud A, which does not cut.

  This tool is introduced by tilting it a little through the orifice of the hole, and we continue to hollow out the inside, pressing lightly until the heel, which does not cut, comes to rest on the outer surface of the hole. ball.

  So we will continue to turn without pressing to finish removing the

---
Page 206 TURNER'S MANUAL.

material to be moved until stud A has reached the edge of the hole drilled in the centerline of the workpiece, and collar E touches the outer edge of the hole in the second ball. At this point, the tool no longer cuts, and the inside of the large ball is finished up to point F, where there is a straight part intended to form the portion of the middle ball, which clips into this one.

  This is what the tool fig. i 3, which is inserted and held in the same way as the previous one, pressing until the D heel touches the outer edge of the hole through which it entered. At this point, if the shape a and b of the cutters has been taken exactly in the figure, the spherical portion F must be completely clear, and present the shape seen in fig. 4.

  It is now a question of removing the material which is enclosed between the arcs of circles .Fet G, which is done with tools 9 and xo. The principle on which these tools are built is always the same. Their edge is preceded by a non-cutting stud, serving as a guide, and followed by a shank at the end of which is a heel that prevents the tool from cutting when it is at its point. The shape of these tools, which must be tiaceous on the drawing of the part itself, sufficiently indicates their use. We first introduce the one fig. 9, which displaces a large enough quantity of material, to give passage to the tool fig. 10, with which we finish digging entirely and in accordance with the figure the part contained between the arcs of a circle. F and G.

  We see here that it is essential to trace first of all, and very regularly, the cut of the three balls, as we said at the beginning of this section, since the slightest error in the form or in the dimensions of the tools, which are determined by this cut, would infallibly cause serious accidents in the execution of this part.

  Here we are at the most difficult operation, which involves hollowing out the inside of the middle ball. This is what the tool fig. 11 is intended for, which, by means of its shape, moves the material contained between the interior and lateral surface of this ball and two planes tangent to the portions of the two neighboring balls stapled in the one we are dealing with.

  When the tool, fig. 11, has fully produced the expected effect, we reIt will be replaced by another, fig. 12, proportionate to the cap of the third ball enclosed in the second, and using this whole, we will succeed in rounding this cap, as seen in the figure.

---
Page 207 CHAP. V. Sect. IX. Stapled balls.

  Then we will withdraw the part from the hollow mandrel, in which it was placed during the course of the operations which we have just described, and we will put it back in a ring mandrel, fig. 2 and 3, Pl. 19, the orifice of which must have for diameter that of the middle ball, and in which the big ball will be caught above its equator, and on a small circle perpendicular to the axis and equal to the big circle of the middle ball. In this state, we will check with the greatest care whether the part turns well, and we will repeat all the operations which we have just detailed, to complete the hollowing out of the parts which are not yet round; that is, the inside of the small L ball; the space H enclosed between this ball and the one in the middle; finally, the space necessary to round the cap of the large ball enclosed in the middle one at point G.

  We will use tools similar to those in fig. 7, 8, i 3, 9, 10 and 12: but always proportionate to the parts on which we operate, and whose shape and dimensions will be taken on the drawing, as well as we said above.

  After we have thus completely hollowed out the parts that should be, we will drill the holes or glasses, which we taught above to trace, on the surface of the three balls. We will first drill a hole in the center of each with a half-line drill, placed in a drill holder that we set in motion with the right hand using a bow, while we presents the piece with the left hand. The drill will then be replaced by the drill bit fig. i4, the stud of which has entered the hole just drilled. In two or three strokes of the bow, donkey b removes a cap of material, and thus completes each hole, giving them all the same shape.

  It should be observed that the glasses of each ball in front, as we said, to be proportionate to the diameter of the one on which they are placed, it will be necessary to use three different wicks.

  The operation that remains to be done is undoubtedly the most delicate; it consists in opening the holes which staple the balls. This can be achieved by drilling a number of holes with a drill in the part of the opening which is on the outer surface of the ball, after which the material is removed with small rounding files, following exactly the line. Then, with the same tools, the portion enclosed in the neighboring ball is released, rounding it as regularly as possible, and taking care to alter the adjacent surfaces. But this way of operating requires a very practiced hand, and we will teach the use of two

--- Page 208 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 24

tools that will make it easier for Hobbyists to cut those holes, and with much more precision.

  The first 11 is something other than the drill bit fig. 14 with which we detach the part of the holes which are on the outer surface of the boxes. The dowel a is placed in a drill hole drilled in the center, and with the beak-dane or tracer b, we make a groove which follows exactly the line of the circumference. In this regard, it is worth noting that by the layout we taught at the beginning of this article, the centers of all these holes are on the outer surface of the balls; which is absolutely necessary in this operation.

  The tool fig. i 5 has a lot to do with the one we just discussed; but, by means of its curvature, we can introduce the tracer b in an opening made on the surface of the neighboring ball, and thus continue the groove on the inner portion of the hole. This opening is on the edge of a nearby hole, and requires no more attention than not altering its circumference. After having thus circled the entire circumference of each of these holes, the material is still retained by a net at the junction point of the two balls. This net is easily removed with small cutting tools, and the edges of the hole are readjusted with suitable small rifflers.

  The glasses that can be seen in the intervals of the openings in fig. 1 are made with a tool in the form of that in fig. i4, but smaller. They are only made after having finished and untied the three balls; moreover they are not essentially necessary, and only serve to give more lightness and delicacy to the room.

  Fig. 2 represents a part which has a lot to do with the one we have just described; it consists of two balls stapled in the same way as the three that make up fig. 1, and enclosed in a sphere formed of two envelopes freely rotating one on top of the other.

  If we have understood what we have just said,one will easily conceive the way in which this piece is performed. However, the outer shell increases the difficulties of the work and requires some precautions which we will describe.

  As this piece requires, like the previous one, the use of a few special tools, and which must necessarily be done on purpose, it is essential to make a single line drawing, similar to that in fig. 5, and in the dimensions that we will have adopted.

---
Page 209 CHAP. V. Sect. IX. Stapled balls.

  Then turn a ball to the diameter of the outer casing, and pierce it on its axis with a cylindrical hole of a diameter equal to that of the openings determined by the drawing, for the glasses of the inner balls; we will mount it on a rod, and we will mark there twelve points which, with the two holes of the cylindrical hole drilled on the axis, will give the centers of the fourteen glasses which are to be drilled on the outer casing. We will use, to regularly space these points, the method that we have previously described, by teaching to divide the large ball of fig. 3.

  In this state, we will place the ball in a ring mandrel, fig. 2 and 3, PL 19, placing in the center of rotation one of the orifices of the cylindrical hole which passes through it. Then using hooks similar to those in fig. 4, 5 and 6, PI. 23, the use of which is known, we will begin to detach the outer casing, reserving the necessary thickness for it to be able to form two concentric envelopes, which will however not be detached until the inner balls are completely finished. To facilitate the insertion of the tools, we will widen the hole of the hole with a side tool, and we will bring it to the diameter determined for the bezels of the outer casing.

  This operation will be repeated on the other orifice of the hole, and then on the other twelve glasses, which will be placed successively at the center of rotation, and thus detach in the interior a spherical mass pierced with a cylindrical hole on its axis. Through this hole, this mass will be threaded onto the shank chuck, and it will be turned on the outside according to the shape indicated by the drawing, passing the tools through the bezels of the outer casing.

  This operation, similar to the one we described when teaching how to make the part, fig. 1, does not present any particular difficulty, except for the introduction of the caliber, which must be narrow enough to be able to pass through a glasses which approach that of the pole of the external envelope. This caliber, fig. 16, ends with a tail which remains outside the opening through which it was introduced, and the use of which will soon be seen. Care must be taken, when tracing it, to mark the points a and ô, corresponding to the equators of the two balls, as well as the points c and d, f and g indicating the twelfth of their circumference from the equator, and through which must pass the two small circles which indicate the position of the eight glasses which are not on the equator.

  When, after finishing the outside of the balls, we want to divide the

---
Page 210 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 24.

surface, we introduce the gauge through one of the glasses next to that of the pole, and we fix the tail on the wedge of the support using a wood screw placed in hole A.

  In this state if the shaft is rotated, the inner balls will follow the movement; but the outer casing will be held by the template, so it will be easy to trace the eight lines along the length of the piece, and to space them equally using the platform. For this, we will use an angled point, which we will introduce through the one of the glasses which will be the most easy.

  We will then draw the equators and the adjacent circles, the position of which is indicated by the points a, b, c, d, f, g, marked on the caliber, and we will thus determine the centers of the spectacles, the circumferences of which will be drawn in introducing the compass through the openings in the outer casing.

  Now it's time to hollow out the interior of the room; and for that it is necessary to remove it from the rod on which it was turned on the outside, and to shorten this rod so that it occupies only half of the hole that it occupies entirely. Then the part is replaced on the rod, and the cavity which appears is hollowed out, first with a tool fig. i 4, Pl-23, and then with tools of the form of those in figs. 7, 8 and 1 3, which we have taught to use.

  We will then turn the piece, pole for pole, by threading it back onto its rod, and we will hollow out the other cavity in the same way, after which all that will be left is to hollow out the portion enclosed between the two balls.

  For this last operation, it is still necessary to shorten the rod, so that it leaves entirely free the portion which one wants to hollow out, and that its end is fixed in the thickness of the inner cap of the ball, which is presented in outside the mandrin. To hollow out this cavity, we will use two tools similar to those in fig. 9 and 10, the use of which we have also taught.

  The glasses placed on the surface of the two balls, and whose circumference has already been traced, open by hand, and with a wick similar to that in fig. 14. As for those by which the two balls are stapled, they are done in the same way by hand, and with the same tools which we used to release the balls of fig. 1.

  This last operation is, without a doubt, the most difficult and the most delicate. The outer casing continually interferes with the movement of the hand and the tool; and the slightest deviation can break a part, which has already cost a lot of time and labor.

  But also, when, with the aid of the expeditions and the tools which we have just described, this piece will have been finished with all the possible regularity, it will certainly excite the attention of the curious, and the admiration of the people who, knowing little the art of the Tour and its effects, will not be able to understand by what means it could have been carried out.

*** SECTION X. Simple chains; Necklaces.

  The objects shown on Plate 25 are still among those which most surprise those unfamiliar with the effects of the Tour. Indeed, it is difficult to understand, at first glance, how we could detach in a piece of wood or ivory the chain fig.1, or the necklace fig.2; the latter above all seems inexplicable, when one realizes that not only are the links all taken in the same piece, as in a chain, but even that their reunion in the form of a necklace has not been made afterwards, and that each ring is held by the two neighboring it. The medal that we see at the bottom of the figure, and on which we can engrave any subject, using the Portrait trick, which we will discuss at the end of this volume, adds a lot to the difficulty; because it is still taken in the same piece, as well as the bail, by means of which it rolls on the neighboring ring.

  We propose in this section to give the Amateurs the means which we used to make these two pieces, and by means of which they will be able to carry out similar ones with more ease than they believe; to be more intelligible, we will start with the chain fig. 1, which is undoubtedly much easier than the necklace.

  We will first point out to the Reader that these kinds of pieces can be made of ivory or wood; ivory is, as we know, easier to work, but, as the main merit here is the difficulty overcome, it is better to use wood, which must be chosen very healthy, very dry, and free from the slightest cracks. French boxwood seems to us to be preferred over other woods, and this is the one we used.

  Before starting to work, it is good to trace on the paper the chain you intend to make, fixing the number and diameter of the rings that will make it up. The number is absolutely unknown

and depends only on the will of the Amateur and the length of the material on which he operates. As for their diameter, we must consider on the one hand that the larger they are, the easier they are to detach; and on the other hand, that the smaller they are, the more they please the eye. We will therefore take an average term, like twelve lines; this is the outside diameter of the rings of the chain that we have made, and that we see shown in fig. 1.

  First, we will turn a cylinder, whose length we will give the half outside diameter of one of the rings, multiplied by the number of rings in the chain, plus one. Thus, to make a chain of six rings, like the one shown in fig. 1, we will take seven times the external half-diameter of one of these rings, which here is six lines, and consequently the cylinder will have forty- two lines; as for its circumference, it must be a little larger than that of the rings. Fig. 3 represents this cylinder on a larger scale, to make the description of the following operations more intelligible.

  We will divide the length of the cylinder into seven equal parts, and by each of the points of division, we will trace lightly with the point of a barley grain the circles parallel and perpendicular to the axis i, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We will then divide one of these circles into four equal parts, through each of which we will lead parallels to the axis. Next to these four lines, four more will be drawn, spaced from the first by the thickness determined for the rings, increased by about a third, which will disappear through work.

  For these operations, use the compass or the divider; the latter method is the best, because all these divisions must be made with the greatest precision.

  Then return the eight parallel to the axis on both ends of the cylinder, which must be perfectly upright. Fig. 4 represents one of these ends, with the eight lines which are drawn there, and which intersect at right angles.

  After these preliminary tracings, we grip the cylinder in a vice parallel to its axis, and so that the lines A and B are above, we give a saw cut outside the line A, and another outside of line B, moving along the part of these two lines, returned to the ends of the cylinder fig. 4, and we will stop at points a and b, same figure. This operation will be repeated three times, successively bringing up the dividing lines drawn along the length of the cylinder.

Pl.25.

  Fig. 5 shows the end of the cylinder after removing three angles, the fourth A is already detached, but we left the material in place to better see the passage of the saw. It is very essential that the eight saw cuts be straight, and especially that they do not pass the points where the eight lines meet.fit on the ends of the cylinder. It is better to stay a little outside the drawn lines, and then approach them as much as possible, by resetting with a bastard file the surfaces exposed by the saw.

  The cylinder, after these operations, presents two plates which intersect at right angles, by their middle; both are of equal thickness, and on their field still remain divisions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which originally divided the length of the cylinder into seven equal parts.

  One of these blades is seized in a vice, by making the two transverse blades press on the jaws; and give three perpendicular saw cuts on the upper blade at points 2, 4, 6, apart from each other by the diameter of one of the rings. This blade is then placed in the jaws of the vice, to do the same on the blade which was pinched there; and the same operation is repeated on the other two blades, but giving the saw cuts on the points 1, 3, 5.

  It is now a matter of cutting with a saw the angles of the portions of the blades separated by these six saw cuts, each of which bears the diameter of a ring along its length. To do this, place the saw about a quarter of the way down, and directing it at 45 degrees to the nearest kerf will remove the angle. This operation wants to be done with precaution; because if you bite a little too much inside, you could easily damage the material intended to form the outside of the circumference of the ring. To avoid this inconvenience, we will do well to prepare a wooden template, as follows. We will turn a thin board fig. 6 to the diameter of the original cylinder, in the middle of which we will drill a round hole having for diameter the thickness of one of the blades. We will divide this board into two pieces, by a saw cut tangent to the hole, and the smallest, equal to half of a ring, minus half the thickness of one of the blades, will be the required caliber, which will suffice to guide the artist in the operation of removing the angles.

  It is on these portions of the blades, thus separated and prepared, that the rings are traced, the inner and outer circumferences of which must be exactly concentric. The center of all these rings is at the bottom of the saw cuts between those in the other row, and vice versa.

---
Page 214 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.25.

  From one of these points, as the center, we will definitely draw the outer circumference of one of the rings, and we will bring the moving point of the compass to the full thickness of the blade, to draw the inner circumference. The same should be done on the six rings, after which they will be rounded off on the outside, with bastard and semi-soft files, approaching as close as possible to the outer line.

  To hollow out the inside, it is first necessary to drill holes with a one-line drill, at points A, B, C, D, etc., where the portions of circles, indicating the inner circumference of each ring, come end on the other blade. We then remove the material contained within the line, using a marquetry saw, fig. 3, PL 25, TI But as in this operation the rings become extremely fragile, we will seize a row between two false wooden jaws , whose cheeks must be perfectly straight, internally, and the saw blade will be threaded successively in all the holes drilled in the part which is above the vice; this operation will be repeated on the part which was between the false jaws, and successively on the other row transverse to the first. If we followed exactly the line, the rings should be roughly hollowed out, and are only joined by a square thread, equal to the thickness of the rings, and in the middle of which passes the axis of the generator cylinder. This net is easily removed with the inlay saw, passing the blade obliquely from the inside to the outside. We then seize all the rings one after the other, in the jaws of the vice to repair with the file the unevenness left by the passage of the saw, both inside and outside, particularly at the points where the net of which we have just spoken. During this work, we will do well to suspend the other rings by a wire, to protect them from accidents.

  All the preparatory operations which we have just described were intended to detach and prepare the rings; Now it's time to finish them on the Tour, which isn't as difficult as you might think.

  Use the mandrel, fig. 7, the interior of which is hollowed out, as seen in the section, fig. 8, to a depth equal to the diameter of one of the rings. On the anterior face there is a bearing hollowed out to a third of the thickness of the rings, in which the one on which we operate is placed. The neighboring rings are received in opening B, fig. 7, made on the circumference of themandrel, and the others are arranged around the mandrel, where they are fixed by a tie of rope or wire, as we see

Page 215 CHAP. V. Sect. X. Simple chains; Necklaces.
Pl.25.
at A in fig.9, which shows the mandrel with the rings mounted; on the Tour.

  As it is rather difficult to make all the rings of the chain regular and equal to each other, by the preparatory processes which we have described, it may happen that some are too tight within the reach of the mandrel, while others are tossing about in it. To obviate this drawback, we give on the circumference of the mandrel two saw cuts forming the cross with the middle of the opening B, fig. 7, and we will then keep the ring placed in the bearing, by means of a copper ring, fig. 10, the two ends of which will be brought closer or less, tightening screw A. as needed.This screw is removed each time a new ring is placed in a mandrel in order to be able to thread the ring into the rings neighbors, as seen in Figure 8.

  After having thus placed the first ring in the scope of the mandrel, so that it exceeds it by approximately two thirds of its height, and arranged the others as we have just explained, we will mount the mandrel on the nose of the 'shaft, and the support will be approached at a sufficient distance so as not to hook the other rings arranged around the mandrel. We will present a small chisel with a bevel of the shape and width of that, fig. 11, Pl 12, T. I, with which we will draw up the inside and the outside of the ring, either that we want to round off the angles later, or we want to let them remain.

  Care will be taken to place the tool starting, above the rings placed in 1 notch which must be in the direction of the axis of the shaft, and at the height of the center, as seen in fig. 9 . In this position, one feels that, if the tree made more than one revolution, the tool striking against the neighboring rings which come back on it, would infallibly break them. Rope B, fig. 9, is intended to prevent this accident. One of the ends of this string is fixed to the front face of the large doll, directly above the pulley, by a peg similar to those of a violin, around which the string is more or less wound, as needed. The other end goes into a shallow hole in the groove of the pulley, and is secured there with an ordinary dowel.

  When you put the Lathe in motion, this rope wraps around the pulley, and thus limits the revolution of the shaft. It will only be observed that in the position where the mandrel is in fig.9, the rope must be stretched and wound on the groove of the pulley; but we have re-

  presented as seen in the figure, to make the description of its adjustment more sensitive.

  We also see the need for the flared shape given to notch B, flg. 7. Indeed, the tool coming to touch, albeit slightly, the upper end of the ring placed in this notch, the other end tends to travel a more or less extensive arc of a circle, depending on the diameter of the ring. ring, and consequently the resistance it would experience, if the notch were straight, would soon break such delicate pieces.

  When, by means of all these precautions, the part of the ring which exceeds the reach of the mandrel has been properly erected, the same operation will be repeated on all the rings which make up the chain, and we will mainly endeavor to make them all. quite regular and equal to each other, using the gauge, fig. 8, Pl 2, of this volume.

  It is now necessary to take care of turning the portion of the rings which was kept within the reach of the mandrel during the previous operation; but this range is now too wide to capture the portion already dres¬ sée, and of which, consequently, the outside diameter is reduced.

  It will therefore be necessary to make another mandrel, or practice another range on the face of the one which we have just used, after having destroyed the first one. However, it will be observed that in this way we destroy a mandrel which has cost a lot of work, and which must always be made of good wood. We therefore recommend rather to Amateurs who will undertake to make this chain to make, by starting, two similar mandrels, within the scope, which in the second must be hollowed out so as to grasp the finished part up to half of the total height. what should the rings have when they are erected. We will turn the non-diessed part with the precautions detailed above, and if we want to round the rings, to give them the shape of a ring, we will immediately and without disturbing the ring of the mandrel, the interior and exterior angles. , by multiplying the sides as much as possible, after which we will finish rounding them with a tool with a speckle, similar to that in fig. 8, PI. 12,T. I, but much smaller, the cutting edge of which presents an arc of a circle a little less than half the circumference. As a ring is completed on one side, it will be turned over to round the other, placing the Uchevée part in the mandrel whose bearing grips the ring to its half; corn ; as then the ring is only held in place by a rounded part, and therefore, much less firmly, extra care must be taken to break down the angles.

  If we have followed exactly all the procedures we have detailed, and: if we have used sharp tools, the chain will be finished, and will hardly need to be polished. If, however, we wanted to give it the most beautiful luster, we could still lightly rub each ring with horsetail or polishing paper, holding it between the fingers.

  The continuous chain, or collar, Fig. 2, ends on the Tour, much the same way we just taught to do; but the preparatory operations are much more complicated and require much more care and patience.

  We executed this piece in boxwood; but what we are going to say can also be applied to any other wood, and even to ivory. The latter material, being much less fragile than wood, would present less difficulty; but for this very reason the piece would have less merit, although it became rather expensive from the difficulty of obtaining a piece of ivory of a sufficiently large diameter.

  We will cut a boxwood board taken from a very healthy piece and absolutely free of cracks, and we will reduce it to a thickness roughly equal to the outside diameter of the rings we want to make. Those of the chain we have made were an inch in diameter, and Fig. 2 shows them reduced to half their size.

  We will draw on a piece of paper the exact figure of this plate, on which we will inscribe a circle with the largest possible diameter. We will then make a second circle concentric with the first, tucking the point of the compass halfway through the diameter of the rings, that is to say six lines, if we take our operation as a model.

  It is the circumference of this second circle that determines the number of rings in the chain, so it is always subordinate to the diameter of the piece of wood or ivory that is used. We will therefore divide the development of this circumference by the outside diameter of a ring, and the quotient will give half the number of rings that will make up the chain. This one in fig. 2 is formed by eighteen rings of one inch each, as we said above, and the inner circle was nine inches three lines in circumference. This excess of three lines is absolutely essential, and it has been distributed among all the rings, to give them the necessary play. If by chance, after dividing the circumference by the diameter of a ring, we had no fraction, or if this fraction presented only an imperceptible quantity, we would be obliged to insensibly reduce the diameter of each rings, in order to

Page 218 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.25.

to always be able to leave between each two a small empty space, of which one will soon feel the need.

  We will then mount the board in a lathe in the air, either on a pigtail mandrel, or with putty, or finally on a universal mandrel. The latter means, exhibiting more solidity, should be preferred. The surface of this board will be drawn up perfectly, in order to carry out all the operations that we are going to detail there, and which are described in fig.11; this figure represents only half of the board, but it is easy to replace by the imagination the other half, which is absolutely similar to this one. We will take with a compass, on the drawing just mentioned, the diameter of the inner circle, and placing one of the points of the compass at the center of rotation A, we will mark with the other a point B towards the edge of the board, then approaching the point of a grain of barley, from this point, we will draw the circle which, as we have seen, determines the number of rings in the chain, and which for this reason we will call the generator circle.

  Inside and outside this first circle, we will describe two other c and d, fig. 11, and in section, fig. 12, concentric with the first, from which they are separated by a little more than half of the thickness of the rings, before they are rotated. Assuming, as we have already done, that the rings are an inch in diameter, this thickness is roughly two lines.

  After this preliminary drawing, we will move about three lines of material over the entire surface of the board outside of circle c. We will then draw a circle C} concentric with the generator circle B, from which it is distant from the half-diameter of the rings, that is to say, in our hypothesis, by sixlines. All the material that is outside this circle is no longer of any use, except for one of the angles from which we will take the D medal.

  As the board was not squared before the operation, we will choose the one of the angles which offers the most surface, and we will inscribe a circle tangent to the circle C, to determine the circumference of the medal.

  This medal, as seen in fig. 2, is joined to the neighboring ring by a bail which embraces the ring of this ring, and moves freely in it. The material on which this bail is taken must therefore be higher than that where the rings of the second row are taken, and we will reserve, inside the outer circle C, a bulge about three lines wide, seen in B, fig. 11, and in cross section, fig. 12, by lowering a

Page 219 CHAP. V. Sect. X. Simple chains; Necklaces.
Pl.25.

line and a half approximately the rest of the surface of the board, both outside the circle and in the kind of channel formed by the bulge E and the circle c. We will also reduce the inside of the board to the same thickness, by a width of about 7 or 8 lines, starting from the circle d.

  It is very important, for the success of the operation, that these different surfaces, separated by the swelling E, and the portion of material enclosed between the circles c and d, which is intended to form the upper row of rings, are all on the same plane; and it would be difficult to obtain this result without the help of the cross square, fig. 7, PL 9 of this Volume.

  Now it's time to detach the part of the plank, thus prepared, from the core, which is no longer of any use. To determine exactly the point where this separation must take place, we will carry towards the interior, starting from point B, an opening equal to BC, and in the same direction, which will end at F. It is at this point that 'we will approach the tip of a barley grain, to detach the entire outer part, leaving the core on the mandrel.

  We will then put this detached part back in an ordinary mandrel, by grasping it, either internally or externally, by the scope c, d, and we will repeat all the operations which we have just described, with the exception of the last, on the other side of the board.

  The bulge E will be destroyed by hand and with a chisel, leaving only the part g which is opposite the angle reserved for the medal, and which is intended to form the bail. Then, with a marquetry saw, we cut the other three angles, following the circle C as exactly as possible, without ever cutting it; after which all that remains is to detach the portion of material that surrounds the circle /), reserving on the side where this circle is flush with the circle C, a space of three or four lines, on which we will take the bail.

  The board, after all these preliminary operations, presents only two circular blades, equal in thickness and height, one vertical, and the other horizontal, which intersect at right angles by their middle, like straight blades. of fig. 5. To the horizontal blade is attached the circle D intended to form the medal.

  We will then take care of tracing, detaching and hollowing out the rings, and we will use for these operations the procedures which we have described at length ', speaking of the simple chain. We will start by dividing the vertical strip into as many parts as it should contain rings,

---
Page 220 TURNER'S MANUAL.

giving the first kerf at the point which is in the direction of the center of the generating circle, and that of the medal. As this saw cut indicates, as we have seen elsewhere, the center of the corresponding circle on the horizontal blade, the bail will lie exactly on a line drawn from the center of the medal to the center of the ring to which it is united. . As you continue to detach the rings from the vertical blade, you will find that they cannot be contiguous. Indeed, the height of these rings being taken on a circular portion, the saw cuts which separate them form part of the radii of the same circle, and necessarily go outwardly diverging, so that these rings present a shape conical, if we do not give at both ends a saw cut ab, fig. i 3, perpendicular to the line c, which represents the chord of the portion of the circle enclosed between the two primitive saw cuts. We will then draw up with a chisel and a grater the Laces of each of these rings, by removing the material which exceeds on one side the chord of the outer circle c, and on the other the tangent d. This should be done before unraveling the inside of the rings; and as it decreases the thickness and the width of the material intended to form them, this is why we recommended above to leave between the circles c and d, fig. 11, a little more than the thickness of the rings; it is also at this considerationration which applies to the observation which we made at the beginning of this article relative to the circumference of the generator circle B, which must not contain precisely a certain number of times the diameter of the rings, in order to be able to space them slightly, by distributing the excess fraction between them.

  The other row of rings taken on the horizontal board does not present all these difficulties, since their circumference is traced on a flat part, as in the simple chain: we will therefore use, to detach and hollow out these rings, means taught for the latter; only care must be taken to reserve the last one to which the medal is attached, and to spare by hollowing out the portion of material intended to form the bail. Figs. i 3 and i 4 represent the part after these various operations. We will immediately round, according to the shape and size determined, the ring of the last ring, which we will seize in a vice, using files and rasps, and we will approach as much as possible to the bail, without the to initiate.

  Likewise, round the bail on the outside, reducing its thickness, until it is equal to its width; after which we will take care

Pl.25.

detach it from the bead of the ring. As this operation requires infinite skill, when it is carried out with small scissors, and small proportionate gouges, we have imagined, to reduce the difficulty, a kind of milling cutter, fig. 15, of which the blade is half -circular, and toothed at its end A-

  Place the concave side of the blade on the ring of the ring, with the teeth against the face of the bail; the blade is then rotated to the right and to the left by pressing lightly, and one thus succeeds fairly quickly in separating these two parts. It will be good to stop, when the cutter has reached about half of the space it must cross, and start again with the other side of the bail: there is less risk of damaging the shape of the ring, and if the blade of the cutter is well aligned, the bail will slide easily on the ring of the ring, although it is separated from it only by an almost imperceptible space.

  All that remains is to complete the rings on the lathe: this is done by means of the mandrel, fig. 7 and 8, and by the methods described elsewhere; we only recommend that you take extra care when turning the one on which the medal is suspended. The two neighboring rings usually go into the notch in the mandrel, and the medal stays out and flat. It will be prudent to shorten the rope which is used to limit the revolution of the tree a little; because the slightest impact of the tool on the bail would inevitably break it. As this ring begins to take its shape, it will be made to rotate on itself and without taking it out of its range, loosening the screw of the ring, fig. 10, in order to reach the part of the ring which was located hidden by the bail and by the neighboring rings.

  If we wanted each link to be composed of several rings, like those in fig. 2, it would be necessary to separate them on the Tour, and with small very narrow beaks, after having erected them, but before round off the angles. We can thus divide each link into two, three, and even four rings, each of which we will give, if desired, a different shape.

  Indeed, although speaking of the simple chain and the chain in necklace, we have only taught, to be clearer, only to round the rings in the shape of rushes, we can however also give them the square shape, triangular, or any other.

  Fig. 16 shows different profiles, from which one will choose the one that suits best. The first is a square ring, with a protruding thread on each of its four corners, which can be further rounded, or

Page 222 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl.25.

leave square. The others all derive from it, and the figures are enough to explain its form.

  An intelligent amateur will combine these various profiles with taste; it will vary with symmetry the number of rings which compose each link; if he has a Tour à portaits, he will engrave a bust, or some interesting subject, on the medal, and he will thus manage to compose a piece which will not be the least ornament of his cabinet.

*** SECTION XI A very delicate and very difficult piece to perform on the Tour in the air.
Pl.21.

  There is hardly any curious cabinet, where one likes to reassemble the most delicate and difficult pieces of Tour, in which one does not place the piece represented in figs. 21 and 22, PL 21, that we only had engraved on this Plate, because its length did not allow us to place it on others, without considerably disturbing the objects which they contain.

  This piece has no definite name that is known to us. Some people call it the Horsehair or Horsehair Piece, because its stem is not much bigger than a strong horsehair. To perform it well, you must have great use of the Tour, and have turned very delicate pieces, be endowed with great patience, and above all not prick yourself of celerity A blow given awkwardly, or without the greatest attention, in an instant loses all the work, and a rather expensive piece of ivory.

  The Tour shaft that will be used should be drilled through its entire length to a somewhat large diameter. Choose a piece of ivory 12 to 15 inches long, perfectly dry, very healthy and without any cracking, which is not very common if it is not taken close to the heart. And as it is not possible to take a piece of ivory of all its natural size, the most suitable is to slit with a saw, in its entire length and in four parts, a piece of sufficient size so that neither the marrow, which is always in the center of the tooth, nor the cracks, which are at its circumference, remain when the piece is roughed out. As the ornamental parts that we see on this piece are hardly more than 6 to 7 lines in diameter, we will rough the piece in

Page 223 CHAP. V. Sect. XI. Piece very delicate and very difficult to execute, & c.

all its length, with a grater, as round as possible, and above all as straight as possible, with 8 or 9 lines.

  A piece of ivory split 12 or 15 inches long, and with such a small diameter, does not fail to torment itself as it dries, which is why we recommend that it be kept larger than necessary. It will even be appropriate, after having split it along its length, to let it work slowly, in a closed drawer, or in some other place where it is not suddenly struck by the air, the drought of which would not be lacking. not to veil it. It will still be prudent to wrap him in dry clothes, only to undress him little by little, until he can withstand the contact of the air without risk. It is easy to see how necessary all these precautions are, since the thinnest part, the horsehair, must be in the same axis, and that, as long as the part breaks, it only presents a portion of a circle that is can not put in the Tour. We only go into all these details because forgetting the precautions we recommend has, more than once, lost the fruits of several days of work.

  To prevent warping of this piece, when splitting it along its length, it is good to observe that a saw, whatever way it has, considerably heats up the surfaces; and that, as they suddenly receive contact with air, if care is not taken to cool them a little, they swell considerably, and the saw cannot pass. Usually a little tallow is used for wood; but for ivory we will, from time to time, put a little water in it, with a small brush. The oil would produce the same effect, but it would stain the ivory yellow; and besides, water refreshes the kerf much better.

  If the ivory had not been kept for a few years, and it was not certain that it was perfectly dry; if, for example, we had just bought it from the merchants, who, to prevent it from splitting, keep it in cool places, and even often damp, it would have to be tied to a piece of wood a little strong and very dry, so that it warps less, and we would keep it in this state for a fairly long space of time.

  So once we have made sure that the piece of ivory has had its effect, we will rough it with a grater, grasping it in a vise with wooden pliers, and we will dress it and round it as much as possible.

  Then we will mount it on the Pointed Lathe, to turn it cylindrically, reducing it to the determined diameter; but like the big one

the length of this piece makes it very flexible, it must be supported by the means indicated T. /, pag. 179, after having rounded with a narrow tool the places that the dowels should touch. It will then be entered into the Tour tree, leaving only what is needed to form the first ornament there. But to contain it, we will mount on the nose of the shaft a split mandrel, perfectly drawn up from the outside, and the hole of which is also well centered and of such size that, as long as we
bring the ring in over, it tightens the ivory enough.

  First, we will form the small vase that we see at the end of the fîg. 22, and we will polish it carefully, so as not to touch it any more, except that we will draw various circles above, on which we will drill a certain number of holes, to receive the stems of the flowers that we have there. sees; and we will place these holes symmetrically, so that the flowers make the bouquet better. As for the flowers that we see in this figure, we make them separately, and we bring them back above the vase, as we will teach elsewhere. When the vase is finished and polished, we will form, between it and the ornament that follows, a rod half a line long, and as thin as possible. A lot of patience and lightness of hand are required here: and as this rod, because of its great finesse, cannot be polished, 011 will use a perfectly sharp donkey's lip to form it, and the we will take very little material at a time, so that it comes out polished from under the tool. We will then form the spheroid or onion, between two squares that we see in the figure, and since this ornament is very small, we will be content to finish it with a tool without thinking about polishing it. We will then make the next rod, and we will make it the size of the one we have already made.

  Although we are master of sparing the kick, and we can make the Tour go as slowly as we want, we must nevertheless give a certain speed to be able to start the material, and we risk breaking the parts already made by the whip which they acquire by turning. In vain would one think that, turning in the same axis, there is no reason for them to come out. If we want to experience it, we will see how much they swing as they turn. There is yet another equally sensitive cause of this effect, when the piece is already a little long: this is that each part of the ornament, however small it may be supposed, is a considerable mass compared to the size. rod that carries it. We must constantly impress upon all these masses a movement, alternately opposed, when the march rises and when it descends. The acquired speed is suddenly stopped to receive one in an opposite direction, and this movement

Page 225 CHAP. Y. Siïct. XI. Piece very delicate and very difficult to execute, & c.
Pl.21.

  movement is imparted to each of these masses only by the axis of the part which is infinitely delicate, which can cause it to break when twisting. So we recommend that you do this part on the wheel instead.

  Whatever motor one uses, one uses, to keep the piece in the same position, small very delicate supports, which it is good to make oneself, and which can be seen represented in AB. in fig. 21. One, A is a fairly light wooden frame, the fourth side of which is long enough that the center point of the square is in the center of the Lathe, and therefore of the part being turned. This long square rod is planted in a hole of the same shape made in a wooden foot, which is placed on the workbench; the long rod rubs in, and you can raise it just a little bit to meet the center, or the axis of the part.

  On each of the four sides of the frame, and in the middle of their length and thickness, two holes are drilled with a fairly fine drill. A fine silk, horsehair or hair is passed through one of these holes, the end of which, after passing through the corresponding hole in the opposite branch, enters the frame through the second hole of the same branch, and comes back. pass through the second hole of the first branch, where it is fixed by a small wooden plug, having the shape of a cooper fusset. We do the same the other way around. These four threads, crossing each other in the center of the frame, form a small square in which the part, held by its axis with very gentle friction, has only the faculty of turning on itself, without the vacillation being able to it. whip. It's just a matter of going small enough and gently enough, that you don't have to worry about the twisting of the rod causing it to break. This support is moved forward or backward, up or down, until it is the proper height and spacing.

  The support B is roughly similar to the previous one, except that one of the sides of the frame is drilled along its length, and slides on an iron rod fixed in the foot C, which can be made of lead, like a ordinary candlestick foot. The stem and the foot of the laboratory candlestick, of which we spoke in the first volume, can be used for this purpose. By this means, it is easy to find the height where the support must be. As many of these supports are provided as are needed to hold the piece together, and new ones are put on as the work moves toward its base.

  If you want to change a medium, nothing is so easy. We remove

the little bouchon, and then the silk becoming loose, we open the loop, and we wear it in another place; after which the silk is tightened and fixed as before.

  When you have formed the desired moldings to the length of an inch or so, loosen the ring on the split mandrel, and pull out of the shaft an inch of the ivory piece. We tighten the mandrel with the ring, and continue like this, not forming the thin rod until after the molding or ornament is finished.

  Do not think about hammering the ring on the mandrel with a mallet: however light you do it, the jerk will soon have broken the part you are dealing with. But as this work does not require great effort on the part of the tool, it suffices to tighten the ring by hand, this yes is very easy, if the surface of the mandrel and that of the interior of the ring are very round and well united. It is here that the screw ring, of which we have spoken elsewhere, would be infinitely convenient, since it tightens perfectly, and does not in any way tire the part which is on the Lathe; but despite the drawbacks to which this method is subject and which we have reported, if it is to be used, the mandrel must be perfectly round, and it must have been threaded with great care.

  We will not stop at describing how to make all the ornaments shown in fig. 22. We'll assume we've gotten to point a, and want to make the kind of slime we see there.

  We are more, in this figure, to gather some difficulties of the Tour in the air, which can be executed on the piece in which we are dealing. We recognize, on inspection, that part a must be made with a rosette with two protruding curves and two reentrants. We will see in one of the following chapters how we can make these kinds of vases, which can only be done with the help of continuous movement. So if we have used the pole so far, we will use the wheel to do this part; and the two-curve rosette will be placed behind the Tower. We can imagine that if ever it is necessary for the Tour to go very slowly, it is above all on this occasion, when the jerks must be reduced as much as possible.

  That's not all: since the whole piece has to move back and forth, the brackets should be placed on the front of the longer rods, so that the part has the freedom to move back and forth without the brackets wobbling. Since we had to make these rods as smooth as possible, they will slide easily between the threads in which they are held.

---
Page 227 CHAP. V. sect. XI. Piece very delicate and very difficult to execute, & c.
Pl.21.

  We could put behind the Tour a rosette with three or four: curves, and the singularity would be much greater.

  After finishing this vase, we will make a slightly short stem, and changing the rosette, we will substitute the inclined plane with which we will make a baluster b, as seen in the figure.

  In the meantime, between the baluster and the ornament that follows, we can form loose rings, which play on the stem. To do this we begin by rounding a slightly thin blade around the circumference; then with a speckle on the right and one on the left, fig. 4 and 5, cut the ring on both sides: then remove the entire middle part, and reduce it to the size of the stem.

  We see from fig. 22, that the ornaments that are made on this piece gradually increase in diameter downwards. We can form any other drawing we want, according to the Artist's taste. This piece will be finished with a tenon of about three lines, which will be used to mount it on its pedestal, on a star ball, a torso column, or any other piece. This tenon should never be replaced by a screw, as this part is too fragile to be able to withstand the force that would be made when screwing it in.

  It is no longer a question of making the flowers that we see at the top, and to succeed in this we will take small pieces of ivory of different lengths, like an inch, others of ten lines, and others finally of eight, and even less. At the end, we will turn a sort of small goblet, the edges of which are turned outwards, and reduced to the smallest thickness. We will then dig the inside, so that they are everywhere the same thickness, and this thickness must be equal to that of a sheet of paper. This first cup with its stem will be left in the mandrel. A very small piece of ivory will be mounted on another mandrel, which will be turned by the rounded end, and of such size that it just fits into the first goblet. The outside will be shaped roughly the same as the inside of the first, so that the reverse of the edges of one fits exactly with that of the other; and when it enters it a little comfortably, we will cut it to such a length, that being in the first, it only overflows it byvery little. We will then put it in a very small mandrel, by the rounded part. We will dig the inside as in the first, and we will put it to the same thickness. We will shoot a third and a fourth similar; and it is conceived that the fourth must be smaller and shorter than the others, so that, being all four in each other, they are

---
Page 228 TURNERS MANUAL,

adapt well enough to each other, and that the edges match each other exactly, without overcoming much. When they are thus finished, and reduced to the least possible thickness, they will be cut out with very fine scissors, forming a slightly fine indentation in them to imitate the eyelet, or two or three indentations to imitate the lily of the valley, and in this case, we will only make a chalice.

  All these operations, which require a great deal of dexterity and patience, are fully described at the end of this Volume, and we refer our readers to them.

  We will keep these flowers, thus finished, in reserve: after which we will take care of making the tail, which must be of the greatest finesse; and this is where you still have to have a lot of patience: because, despite the lightness of this chalice, the rotation can break the tail. It is much easier to make these tails on a wood to be filed, and with bastard files first, and thin at the end, by grasping the piece of ivory in a loop or screw pliers, in the same way make a pin, and at the end pushing the file lengthwise, so as not to break this tail, which is very delicate; and in this case, we will be satisfied to make a certain quantity of these stems, and to glue them cleanly with fish glue, under the calyx of the flower, and then on the vase. Finally, we will cut this tail to the length we want; and if we intend this flower in the middle, we will make it a little longer. Take the vase from the end of the long piece, between your fingers, resting the whole on the workbench near a vice. We will glue all three chalices, one inside the other, and in the first, crossing the serrations, to better imitate the eyelet, then we will cleanly glue the stem in the hole in the center of the vase.

  We will then turn other flowers, which we will vary at will, forming in some only a chalice to imitate the lily of the valley, and several in the others to imitate other flowers, always putting the highest, the most strong and most composed in the middle.

  When leaving the Tour, all the tails of these small flowers are straight, and cannot form a bouquet. These tails will be dipped in clear water, and after having left them there for some time, they will easily be able to give them the curvature you want with your fingers, using great care and care; and as the holes on the vase must be made on the circumference of different circles, we will give each of the flowers which must be on the same circle the same length.

Page 229 CHAP. V.Sect. XI. A very delicate piece and very difficult to execute, etc.
curvature, so that the entire bouquet makes the chandelier or upside down lamp base.
Pl.21.

  If we make these stems separated from their chalices, as we have just taught, we can take them from an ivory circle of a fairly large diameter, which we will turn as thin as we want, by mounting it. on a triboulet. By this means they will naturally have the same curvature, if we cut them all of equal length.

  To make felt the necessity of making all these flowers infinitely thin and light, it suffices to observe that, as long as their whole has even a little weight, they could not be supported by the long piece, without tilting one or the other. on the other hand, at the risk of breaking it, or at least keeping it bent; which produces a bad effect, since the merit of this whole room is to be perfectly upright, and to be able to stand upright when all the movements of liberation, which its extreme finesse causes, are annihilated.

  Such are the details of execution of a piece, the extreme delicacy of which deserves all the merit, and well worthy of decorating the cabinet of an Amateur: but it is necessary to have an unfailing patience to bring it to its end without nothing break.

  As this piece, being finished, is very fragile, and however careful one takes it, it is possible that an indiscreet or awkward hand will break it when it is in place, it is more prudent to put it under a glass jar. .

  If one wants to mount this piece above a torso column, surmounted by a star ball, or on any other delicate piece, the whole presents a very great height; and it is hardly possible to find a jar high enough to cover it. But one can easily get glass tubes of any length and any size, in which the piece, whatever its length, is maintained upright. By this means we protect the room from the garbage that flies would drop there, we preventwhen it does not yellow so quickly, and any accidents that could happen are prevented.

** CHAPTER VI. Fluting Machine; Pendulum.
*** SECTION ONE. Description of the Column Fluting Machine.
Pl. 26.

We spoke, in chapter XI of the first volume, of the difficulty which one experiences in making regular splines by hand on a column, and we referred to this one the description of a suitable machine for this use.

  To date all those which have been used have the very serious disadvantage of making the grooves as wide towards the top as towards the bottom of the column; however, the diameter of the top, being notably less than that of the bottom, because of the bulge, it follows that the grooves come to merge at their upper end, or that their intervals become almost harmful, according to the order of architecture to which belongs the column.

  It is this imperfection that we have sought to correct by the construction of the fluting machine, Pl. 26, and we flatter ourselves that we have succeeded, if not rigorously and mathematically, at least in such a way that the defect is no longer noticeable. at the eye.

  This machine is mounted on a wooden cage, seen in elevation over its length, fig. 1, and over its width, fig-2.

  A is the sole over the length of which rise on each side three mounts B, B, C, which bear a parallel ruler D.

  Between these mounts is a piece of wood F, fig. 3, which moves, like a seesaw, at the third of its length, on two points e, which enter notice in two holes drilled on the mounts CC, about an inch from the sole. Two screws G G, placed at the two ends of this part, are used to make it move, butting against the sole. Their head is half-sided or

gaudrée, so that it can be more conveniently grasped between the fingers.

  Inside the screws, and on the moving part F, two grooves are made, in which slide two dolls with points H /; the latter has a ratchet, the use of which we will soon see. Both are fixed to the moving part F, like the lathe dolls on the workbench, by means of two bolts with hexagonal heads.

  We see in L, fig. 3, 4 and 5, a column mounted between these two dolls, the points of which enter the centers on which the column has been turned.

  It is appropriate to observe that, when one turns a column intended to be splined, one must reserve at its upper end a tenon to receive the toothed wheel a, fig. 3 and 4, carrying a division into forty or sixty- twelve. It is with the help of one or the other of these divisions that we regularly space the grooves, by conforming for their number and their dimensions to the rules prescribed for each order, and which we will give at the beginning of the next section. Four pressure screws fix this toothed wheel on the tenon reserved for the column, and the pawl i, placed on the doll I, entering the teeth of the wheel, fixes the column at the appropriate point for each spline.

  Figs. 5 and 6 represent the jaw harp, which carries the tool with which we dig the grooves, and we give them the shape they must have: these are the two handles which are used to make it move along the two parallel rulers DD, fig. 4, on which it slides, by means of two grooves bb, fig. 6, which embrace these two rulers. In the middle of the jaw harp is mounted the tool holder, which is nothing more than a sort of reel, the shaft of which is pierced, at its lower end, with a square hole to receive the head of the tool. .

  The two dolls of the reel are carried by an iron slide, which descends between two slides fixed by four screws on a plate which unites the whole.

  Behind the plate is a set screw, used to lower 1 tool as the groove deepens.

  The upper part of the shaft extends about an inch beyond the body of the jaw harp, and receives at its end a crank 1, which serves to silence the tool in a circular motion, to round the ends of the grooves.

  At the bottom third of the portion of the tree, which is between the two

Page 232 TURNER'S MANUAL,

dolls, there is a square part. When we want to dig the grooves along their length, we place between this square part and the plate a wedge which fixes the shaft, and prevents it from turning.

  We see in C, fig. 2 one of the four claws, by means of which we limit the space that the jaw harp must cover on the parallel rulers, and which is determined by the length of the shaft of the column.
*** SECTION II. Usarge Fluting Machine.

  Before teaching how to use the fluting machine, which we have just described, we believe it is appropriate to give the principles taught by the rules of architecture, for tracing the flutes of the Doric and Ionic orders. Tuscan is not susceptible to this ornament; and the Corinthian, as well as the composite, follow the same rules as the ionic.

  The Doric column has twenty flutes on its circumference, which join at sharp angles, and without leaving any gaps between them. Their cut usually has the shape of an arc equal to the sixth part of the circumference of a circle, having for radius the chord of an arc of a circle equal to the twentieth of the circumference of the shaft of the column. Here is how to draw this figure on paper.

  We describe a circle fig.7 whose circumference is equal to that of the bottom of the shaft of the column, we divide it into twenty equal parts. Place a compass point on one of the division points, and the other on the neighboring point; and we draw an arc of a circle outside the circle to d; another is drawn from point c and point d, where these two arcs intersect; we draw the arc of a circle b, c, the shape of which is exactly that which the Doric groove must present.

  The ionic column has 24 grooves separated by a border equal to half the width of the groove. Their cut presents a semi-circle having for diameter the chord of the thirty-sixth of the circumference of the shaft of the column, that is to say of the groove itself. Tracing this figure presents no difficulty, and we will not dwell on it any longer.

  Whatever the order of the column one proposes to flute, it must first be completely finished, because it would no longer be possible

Pl. 26.
to touch it up when the flutes are done. We will not forget to reserve at the top the tenon we talked about in the previous section, and we will draw three circles in pencil on the shaft; one at the start of the grooves towards the base, the other one third of the way down, at the start of the decrease caused by the bulge; and the third at the end of the flutes, below the capital.

  The column being thus prepared, one begins by fixing on its tenon the toothed wheel by means of the four pressure screws, after which one assembles it by its two centers, between the points of the two dolls H, I fig. 3, by placing the high on the side of the headstock /, carrying the pawl i, which engages with the teeth of the wheel. The two dolls are brought together as much as necessary, so that the column is securely held between the points, and so that the circle drawn at a third of the height is just above point e, on which the part which bears the dolls rocking.

  A tracer Fig. 8 is then placed in the jaw harp, with the help of which is drawn along the length of the column, parallels to the axis, which determine the width of the grooves and their intervals. If the column is of the Doric order, place the division into forty on the tenon, and rotate it by two teeth in each row, which will indicate the sharp angle between the two grooves; and when these lines are all drawn, we will advance the wheel by one tooth, in order to replace vertically the middle of the spline below the tool.

  For the Ionic or Corinthian columns, we will use the division into seventy-two, and we will pass two teeth for each groove, and one for each interval. To then replace the middle of the splines vertically under the tool, we will successively put the ratchet in the teeth that we jumped while making the outline.

  The round tool, fig. 9 or fig. 11, is then put back into the jaw harp, depending on the order of the column. We put it back on the parallel rulers D, D, figfiel5, and after having brought it towards the base of the column, we lower the tool by means of the return screw, until it comes to touch the circle drawn there on the surface of the barrel. Then one raises or one lowers the movable board F, fig.3 and 5, by means of screws placed at its two ends, until the lower third of the column presents a line parallel to the two rules Z), D; which can be checked by moving the jaw harp over this part of the column, after raising the tool a little.

  The four claws are then fixed on the parallels, in order to limit the stroke

of the Jew's harp, following the length of the grooves, after which the Jew's harp is brought back to the base; the tool is lowered until it bites, and the crank is made a turn or two, to start the spline, and to give its end the rounded fourme it should present. We deepen this hole a little, after which we raise the tool, and we slide theJew's harp, to the other end of the groove, where you make a hole similar to the first, but a little shallower. This operation is repeated on all the splines, each turning the toothed wheel a, from two teeth of the division into forty or three teeth of the one into seventy-two, depending on the order of the column.

  When the base and the top of all the grooves are thus roughed out, we will bring the jaw harp back to the base of one of them, and we will walk it along the entire length of the shaft, lowering the tool gradually as that we move matter. During this operation, care will be taken to fix the tool by means of the wedge which is placed under the shaft of the reel, and when the spline is close to reaching its depth, this wedge will be removed each time we arrive at the lower end, to make the crank make one or two revolutions, in order to clean the bottom, the rounded shape of which will thus connect perfectly with the rest of the groove.

  We can imagine that when the lower third of the groove is dug to the prescribed depth, the other two thirds will not be completed, since, by the position we have given to the rocking piece, this portion of the column is too inclined. in relation to the rulers that wear the jaw harp, and therefore shuns the tool; but this part will not be taken care of, and all the splines up to the third of the column will be completed beforehand; then the finished part will be lowered a little, by means of the screws which move the rocking part until the upper part is high enough so that the tool can reach in its course all the material contained between the two ti ' aits that indicate the width of the groove. We will not forget to turn the crank when reaching the upper end of the groove, as we did on the other side, and we will only remove very little wood in the last passes, to give the finish. inside.

  One should not fear in these last operations of damaging the lower part which is finished; because, by raising the upper part, the lower part has necessarily lowered, and when the tool reaches the point where the bulge begins, it stops biting.

---
Page 235 CHAP. VI. Sect. II Use of the fluting machine.

  Although we have said, when teaching how to dig the length of the grooves, that one must start at the base, if the grain of the wood is in the other direction, one could start indifferently with the upper two-thirds. To do this, you would have to turn the tool around, so as to put the bevel in, and bring the jaw harp back to you, instead of pushing it forward: moreover, the way to operate is absolutely the same.

  If we have observed exactly all that we have said, the column will be grooved very regularly, and we will see the grooves decrease in width and depth, in proportion to the reduction of the shaft. If the column is Ionic or Corinthian, the intervals will also decrease in the same proportion.

  Sometimes in the grooves of the columns of these latter orders, sticks are reserved which go up to a third of the column. If we wanted to perform this kind of splines with our machine, we would first have to replace the round tool with the one in fig. 10, which is placed in the same way in the jaw harp, and whose shape has roughly a recessed quarter of a circle.

  We place the column entered the dolls, As in the first operation, and we check if the lower part which must bear the sticks is indeed parallel to the rules D D, by walking the jaw harp on these rules. We then bring the jaw harp towards the base, and after having lowered the tool until it bites, we make a half turn with the crank, which begins to rough the bottom of the groove and the end. of the wand, giving both the shape they should have. In this state we push the jaw harp towards the upper part, without worrying about the effect that the tool produces beyond a third of the column, since this effect will be destroyed when we dig this upper part. You just have to avoid pushing the harp too far; and, after stopping it, the tool is made a second half-turn to bring it back to the base and thus rough the other side of the groove. This will continue, giving a little iron on each pass, until the groove and the wand are completely finished.

  The same operation is done on all the splines, after which we put the round tool fig. 9 back into the jaw harp, and we finish the upper part, as usual, always turning the crank at both ends, which will produce at the upper end of the sticks the kind of whistle that one notices there.

  One of the most essential conditions for success in the different

---
Page 236 TURNER'S MANUAL,
Pl. 26.

operationns that we have just described, it is the accuracy and regularity of the shape of the tools that must always present the hollow of the groove in relief, according to the order of the column. It is especially very important that the cutting edge and the circular portion of the tool lie in the axis of the grinder shaft, otherwise the tool, by pivoting, will widen the bottom of the groove too much. To achieve this accuracy, the tool must be mounted in the jaw harp before cutting it; we will lay the jaw harp flat, and turning the crank with one hand, we will approach a point with the other, with which we will mark a center point on the face intended to form the cutting edge. This point will serve as a guide to determine the midpoint of the curvature, as well as the origin of the bevel.

  We have given in this Volume different means for drawing along the length of a cylinder parallels to the axis, separated by given intervals, to make torsos, screws; the fluting machine can be used for this purpose with great advantage, as discussed in this section.

*** SECTION III. Truncated column: Way of the Fluting by hand.

  One of the most pleasing pedestals on which a beautifully executed lathe piece can be placed, and worthy of adorning an Amateur's cabinet, is a fluted and truncated column some distance from its base. We will first teach a few words how to perform this piece, and then we will go into some details on the means that can be employed, to flute it by hand, in favor of Amateurs who do not have fluting machine.

  We will start by tracing the profile of the column on the paper, to give the different moldings from the base the projection that they should have, and we will determine the module, depending on the room for which it is to serve as a pedestal; which is all the easier, since the column must always be truncated below the bulge, the upper diameter of the barrel will be equal to that which touches the base, and which, as we know, is used to determine the value of the modulus.

  Then, by the procedures and following the principles taught in the first volume, the shaft, the base and the plinth will be turned, taking each piece in a separate piece, so as not to lose material unnecessarily.

---
Page 237 CHAP. VI. Sect. III. Truncated column, etc.
Pl. 27.

In order to be able to join these three pieces together when they are finished, care must be taken to reserve a tenon on the underside of the shaft, which enters into a bearing provided on the upper face of the base. A second reserved tenon below the latter enters a range hollowed out on the upper face of the plinth, and thus unites these two parts.

  When the column is completely finished, the barrel will be mounted on the fluting machine; and as the grooves must be equal throughout their length, the position of the dolls in the groove is quite indifferent; the column just needs to be parallel to the rulers that carry the jaw harp, which is achieved by placing the toggle parallel to the sole. All the splines will then be made with the precautions detailed in the previous section.

  If we wanted to make a similar part, without having a fluting machine, we could make the flutes by hand by the means that we are going to give. We will only observe that these means, good for the part which occupies us, could only with difficulty be employed to flute an entire column, because of the length of the shaft and the progressive reduction of the flutes, which it would be almost impossible to achieve. reduce regularly.

  After having mounted the shank of the column at the Tower in the air, by placing the tenon in a mandrel, one will divide it into twenty-four equal parts, either with the divider, or with the compass, and one will draw by each point of division of the parallel, between which we will draw twenty-four others, at the distance prescribed to determine the respective width of the grooves and flower beds, according to the rules we gave at the beginning of the previous section. A circle will then be drawn in pencil near the fillet to indicate the start of the grooves, and a second circle distant from the first by half the width of the groove.

  On this second circle we mark a point in the middle of each groove, and from these points as centers, with a compass opening equal to half their distance, we will draw semi-circles which will come flush with the circular line drawn near the fillet. , and will thus indicate the rounded shape that the grooves must have at their birth. To determine their depth, we trace on the front face of the column a circle concentric with the circumference of the shaft, and distant from the edge of half the width of the grooves; This is the circle on which the top of all the splines will end.

  When the twenty-four grooves are thus traced by their two

ends and along their length, it is a question of hollowing them out, and for this, we will first use a bit roughly similar to the one shown in fig. 3, PI. 11, T. I, but with rounded corners, which will be placed in the drill box, same figure. Then put a chair support ’, 16, PI on the workbench. 29 of this Volume, which will be moved back until the drill box can be placed between the column and the support shim. The end a of the drill holder enters the wedge of the support, which here is the office of conscience, and the point of the bit is placed on one of the center points indicated on the second circle, which we bring for this purpose at the height of the center of the Tour. The bit is set in motion with a bow, pushing the holder forward as the point penetrates the material, until the hole approaches the bottom of the groove.

  When we have repeated this operation on the twenty-four points, we will substitute for the drill a round milling cutter of the shape of the one in fig. 16, PI. 11, T.I,
*** SECTION IV. Pendulum Box.
  To apply the principles we have just established to a room worthy of occupying up. Amateur, and suitable at the same time to adorn a cabinet, we are going to give the details of the execution of a small pendulum box, suitable to be placed on a fireplace, and in which everything, except the movement and the bronze ornaments, is the responsibility of the Turner.

  Pl 27 represents this pendulum, with all its developments. Fig.1 shows it in elevation. Fig.2 shows the section, perpendicular to its base; and fig. 4 shows the plan of the column and the vessel, on which is a serpent, which, with the tip of the tongue, marks the days of the week, as seen in fig. 1

  As ivory is a precious and expensive material, we try to spare it as much as possible: thus, in the construction of the room which occupies us, we will be careful not to take, for the whole room, a piece of gold. ivory of the size necessary to find the diameter AB, which is that of the base: still it would be necessary to take it a little larger, so that the crust, being removed, the cracks which are almost always found on the surface of the the ivory were also carried away; and the loss would be considerable, if this piece were reduced to the diameter C D, from the top.

  This piece will be made of six pieces, including the vase and its cover. First, the pedestal AB, whose top e, f, will not bear a torus, and will be quite square, as we see in fig. 2, since it is covered with a piece of molten copper, and adorned, if desired, with leaves, or quite simple, as in fig. 1. The column can be in one piece, and will be joined to the pedestal, screw, in g, h. The column will be terminated by the piece C D, added to screw; and the vase will be fixed to the column, to screw, in i y k. In this way, only ivory will be used, of the size approaching the diameter required; and even, as the base and the column must be drilled in their entire length, it is possible, to save even more money, to take the hollow part of a tooth. We'll just turn each piece inside, for more cleanliness.

  We will first saw a piece which, being finished, can have the diameter of the plinth Z, ra, and for length, the height e l, f m. We will carefully examine whether it is very healthy; and to judge better, it is on the thickness that we will recognize if any cracks that it may have penetrated a little before. When we have made sure of its good quality, we will put it in the mandrel, making it enter, and we will round it inside; after which we will screw the cap é ?, and we will draw up, with great care, the end Z, m. We will then put it back to the mandrel, through the screw we made for the cap, taking a few steps, and a well-drawn shoulder to a somewhat short mandrel, so that the tool does not graze. We will rough the part externally, not with

Page 241 CHAP. VI- Sect. IV. Pendulum box.

gouges, because ivory cuts badly with a gouge, and the edge of this tool does not resist; but with a round chisel, a little thick, and with a 1st bevel, 011 unite the straight parts with straight scissors, and the moldings with suitable tools, scraping, as is done for wood, since ivory does not not cut. We will therefore make all the moldings with the greatest care and the greatest regularity. We refer to the part e, f, which covers the pedestal, to the small shoulder that we see there. Polish everything with horsetail and water, crossing the lines as much as possible, without damaging the moldings; and we will finish with white Spanish ground and prepared in water, as we have taught elsewhere; and a clean cloth soaked in water will be used for this. We say clean laundry; for if it had already been used, the color which it would have contracted would be imprinted in the ivory, and would alter its whiteness. We will set this part apart, without removing it from its mandrel.

  We will turn the column in the same way, first internally: we will make at the bottom the shoulder by which it rests on the pedestal, as well as the screw g, h, and we will adjust it well in the nut which is at the bottom. pedestal. Then having screwed it on a new mandrel, we will rough it out on the outside, and we will prepare the moldings. We will also screw, and very cleanly, the top C D cap, and we will make the nut that must receive the foot of the vase. We will put the pedestal, mounted on its mandrel, on the Lathe: we will mount the column there, and we will finish it in its place. This means is the safest so that this assembly of added parts is perfectly straight.

  When the column is finished and polished, we will remove it from its place, and we will put it on the mandrel on which it was roughed. We will divide the grooves, and we will hollow them out, very carefully, in the way we havens taught, either by machine or by hand.

  We will then take care of drilling the Bezel (this is what we call the hole that should receive the dial). A mandrel will be chosen which has a diameter of approximately twice that of the column. We will draw on the face a circle with the exact diameter of the column; then having fixed the Lathe shaft, and turned the support chair parallel to the face of this mandrel, we will draw two parallels, which are tangent at two points opposite to the diameter of this same circle. Then grabbing the mandrel in a vice, and spreading the legs of a spring compass, half the diameter of this circle, we will draw on the sides of the mandrel a semicircle, the center of which

---
page 242 TURNERS MANUAL,
Pl. 27.

or in the middle of the distance, between the two parallels, and whose ends fall on the ends of these two parallels. The groove between these parallels will be carefully hollowed out, which will provide just enough space for the column to be applied across it. It will be fixed to it by some means, such as by two small strips, also grooved, and which, put across, will embrace the column by half, which exceeds the surface of the mandrel. They will be secured, with two screws each, which enter the mandrel, from eight to ten lines. In this state, the column will be held transversely, and the telescope can be hollowed out.

If we had in our laboratory, the vertical eccentric fig. 7, PI 37, we could use it advantageously in this circumstance.

This operation requires only a little lightness of the hand, and a little care. As the sharp edges presented by the grooves are very delicate, and a blow with a tool given inconsiderately could cause splinters, we will use a very sharp barley grain, and we will go to very small strokes throughout the operation: because, given that the column is cylindrical, we must spare all these grooves, which the tool only starts successively. When, therefore, the hole is entirely open, a side tool will be used, which, penetrating a little before into the column, carries the material circulating: but this tool must cut very sharply, and carry away a little at a time. It is by the diameter parallel to the height of the column that one should judge which to give to the telescope, and not bother in any way with which one is perpendicular to it.

As this operation presents many difficulties, it might be more prudent to drill the hole before completing the column. We would place a stopper of the same material in it, after which 011 would finish it, and we would normally groove it. In this way, there is no risk of splinters, and thus spoiling a part which would have already cost a lot of time and work.

This hole would have a bad effect if one were content to apply the dial to the column; but since there is necessarily a void on both sides, it is to hide it that we have accompanied the dial with the two folded wings that we see there. They are of copper, carefully repaired, and gilded with ground gold, as are the rest of the ornaments, which can be seen in fig. 1. We can put a ribbon bow, as seen here, and, instead of the two wings, drop, on both sides of the dial, a garland of leaves or flowers, as we see fit: and all these ornaments are fixed with small copper screws, which are hidden

heads with intelligence, and whose body takes in the ivory that has been tapped before. The bezel, or frame that receives the glass, is a copper circle adorned with a row of pearls, and which opens hinged to the left, to be able to wind the clock.

If we want this clock to mark the days of the week, we will make the vase of two pieces, as seen in fig. 2 ": the cover can be fixed to the body of the vase, by means of a screw made at the bottom. center; the space lm is intended to receive a circular copper band, on which are inscribed the days: this band turns freely in its place, and in its revolution presents successively all the points of its circumference, under the tongue of the serpent. The snake and the other accessories are of gilded copper, both matt and burnished.The plan of the column has been shown, as seen from a bird's eye view, to make the grooves visible.

It remains now to make the ornaments that we see on the pedestal. The quadrilles which are there must be drawn with the greatest regularity; and to get there, here's how it should be done.

It must first be observed that, if we want these quadrilles to end regularly high and low, the height of the cylindrical part on which they are drawn must be contained an exact number of times in the circumference. Thus, for example, the height of the cylinder, in fig. 1, is contained five times in the circumference which bears ten quadrilles, while the height in prefeel two.

We will make a support wedge, cut from the top, at an inclination of forty-five degrees, relative to the top of the chair. When it is in its place, it will be reduced to a width such that it just fits into the space between a, c, fig. 1. We will trace, with a fine steel point, all the diagonals on the circumference of the pedestal; then having made another wedge inclined, also of forty-five degrees, but in the opposite direction, 011 will draw lines, starting from each end, to the right and to the left of those already drawn. And since each of the cords that form these quadrilles must have a certain width, this width, once determined, and the number of points it requires on the divider being known, we will draw second lines parallel to the first, and we will have the cords as shown, fig. 1.

When they are thus plotted, it is a question of updating their intervals; and for this, we will make a drill hole for everyone, as large as possible, without reaching the lines that end them. We will then hollow out, in a square, with small fine-toothed hulls, and then

Page 244 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 27.

with flat and triangular files, following the lines with great precision.

Since the rushes that form these quadrilles must have the effect of a fabric, they must pass alternately above and below each other: we will hollow, to a certain extent, those which should appear to pass under, near the joints; which will bend and raise them alternately; and we will use for this operation small files, first bastard, then soft, and finally very fine customs.

The rosettes shown in fig. 1 are of gilded copper, and attached to the bottom. We will begin by turning a cylinder of some good wood, which fits into the pedestal a little comfortably. Cover this cylinder with a sheet of straw, the color you think is appropriate. We call Paillon, a very thin sheet of copper, having a well polished surface, and on which we put a colored varnish. There are those spangles made with tin foil, thin as paper, and varnished, yellow, green, purple, blue, or any other color. Sometimes even to make these spangles even more pleasant, they are pressed strongly between two copper plates, one of which is engraved in the manner of moire: one even imagines to moirer a sheet of tin in this way, and one places it under a colored glass which, imparting its color to the leaf, produces the most pleasant effect. This is how we made funds on snuffboxes. A gold number or portrait was then placed on this first mirror, which was then covered with a white glass or mirror. We are only going into these details to give our Readers the means to adorn various pieces that ds can work on on the Tour; back to our pedestal.

The sheet of which we say that we can double the pedestal, if it were placed in the direction of its height, would necessarily present a joint at some point of its circumference; and so that this seal is not visible, we will stick the sheet of straw on the cylinder, diagonally, following the inclination of the rods; and the gasket will fit easily behind any of these rushes. ' When the sheet has been carefully laid out, and completely dry, the cylinder, which will first of all be reduced to two or three lines of thickness, will be introduced into the interior of the pedestal; and if the measurements have been taken well and executed well, it will apply just against the ivory, and give it much luster by the opposition of the whiteness to the colored background.

All the rosettes will be melted, repaired with care, and gilded; we will drill them, in the center, with a very small hole, and we will fix them on the cylinder of

wood, by means of a small copper rod fixed with screws on the back, and in the center of the rosette.

In the same way, the founder will be given the molding G, fig. i, the model of which may be of wood, and the ornaments of modeling wax. We will first make a lead proof of it, in order to be able to repair the defects which are there, and so that, cast on this lead, it comes out sharper in copper. When it is melted, we will finish it on the Tour, and we will make there the staff by which it must enter on the square part e, f, fig. 2: by this means, we will be assured that when returning from the gilder, folds will go exactly in its place. It is the same with all the other ornaments of copper which must be placed, as well on the base as on the column and on the vase.

Instead of these ornaments, which are foreign to the art of the Tour, one could perform on this basis various full or up-to-date ornaments, using the Guilloche Tour. We will give several examples of this in the chapter on the Guilloche lathe.

*** SECTION V. Ivory Pendulum Movement.
Pl. 28.

Always full of the desire to present to our Readers the means to exercise their talents on objects worthy of amusing them, by contributing to their instruction and to their advancement in the Art of Touring, we believe we can offer them a piece of which the execution requires several kinds of industry, and which, when executed with care, combines the useful with the pleasant.

  The Pl. 28 represents a pendulum, where everything, down to the movement, is executed in ivory. This masterpiece of skill and patience was communicated to us by an Amateur; and such was the intelligence which had directed all the combinations, and the dexterity which had executed all the parts, that in the short space of time that this part remained in our hands to make it draw and describe it, its progress us appeared as regular as the material of which it is composed could allow.

  Fig. 1, Pl.28, represents the clock all mounted, on a piece of Tuscan architecture, which can be executed either in ivory or in ebony, raised with parts of ivory, in the same way as one taught for the small temple, represented Pl. 39, T. 1. Thus, we do not

Page 246 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 28.

we will stop describing any of the ornaments and accessories which carry the pendulum: it is with its movement alone that we will concern ourselves.

  Before building any of the parts that go into the composition of the movement, all the parts must be fixed in relation to their diameter, their height, finally all their dimensions, as well as their respective position: this is what we will do on a copper plate a little thin, well erected, and smoothed on one side with pumice, or with a stone that watchmakers use for this purpose, which is quite soft, of a fairly even grain, of a greenish gray , and that one uses while wetting it: but one will not polish this plate. We will trace the plane of the movement, by describing, with a steel compass, circles equal to the diameter that must be given to each wheel and to each of their pinions, in the manner shown in fig, 2, where to make more sensitive to the respective position of all the wheels, we have drawn a circular line to all the parts which pass above a wheel, and where we have punctuated the parts which pass below. If we want to follow in the drawing, fig.2, each of these wheels, comparing them each to each, in fig.3, we will recognize, and their position, and the effect that they must produce. We will see that the driving force coming from the barrel, the wheel it carries drives the sixty-six, and this one drives the sixty-four; that this last being in the center, and carrying the needle, these three wheels would suffice, if it were not necessary to slow down the movement, for this wheel sixty-four to make only one revolution in twelve hours: that we have obtained, by means of the other three wheels, of which the last fourteen turns only as much as the exhaust allows.

  This caliber, thus made, is used to determine the position of the wheels between the plates and the holes of the pivots which carry them. We see from fig.3, that all the mechanism is enclosed between three plates; namely, the movement itself, between the plates e e, etyy *, and the quadrature between those dd and e e.

  In the center is a wheel numbered 64, because it has sixty-four teeth. At its center is an eleven-tooth pinion, called Ailes. This wheel, by means of its pinion, is driven by the wheel numbered 66, number of its teeth, which meshes with the pinion of the center wheel. In the center of the wheel sixty-six, is a pinion of twelve, which is driven, along with the wheel itself, by that of the sixty-eight, which is fitted to the barrel. This barrel contains the spring. The ratchet wheel, seen on the barrel, is tree-lined on the square of the shaft; and by means of

---
Page 247 CHAP. VI. Sect. V. Pendulum movement in ivory.
Pl. 28.

pawl and the spring that can be seen there, it serves as a winder, stretching the spring through the center.

  The center wheel, has sixty-four teeth, meshes with a pinion of ten, on the rod of which is enarbrée the wheel numbered 62, and which has this number of teeth: this one meshes with a pinion of nine, which is at center of the wheel of sixty, which follows it, and this one, in a pinion of eight, on which is the escapement ratchet wheel, which carries fourteen teeth. Thus the barrel drives the wheel of sixty-six teeth; this one leads the wheel of sixty-four, which leads that of sixty-two, which in turn leads that of sixty, and finally the latter leads that of fourteen.

  As far as possible, we have made evident in fig. 3 the effect of each of these wheels, and of the pinion it carries. It is conceivable if all these cogs were abandoned to the impulse of the driving force, that is to say of the spring enclosed in the barrel, it would run with the greatest rapidity, and that this speed would increase.it still in such a proportion that the band of the spring would be exhausted in two or three minutes, and that all the teeth of the curving wheels risk being carried away in an instant. It was therefore necessary to let the last motive, that is to say the wheel of fourteen, run only little by little, in an equal and constant manner; and this is what has been achieved in all clocks, by means the principle of which is the same, but which differ from each other in their execution. Here we have adopted the escapement named Ancre, because indeed, a kind of anchor receives alternately on its two branches the teeth of the ratchet, or to speak better of the escapement wheel numbered 14.

  Behind the plate f, f, fig.3, is a part shown in profile, same figure, and on its outer face, fig.4. This piece, called Coq or Coqueret, bears the pivot of a steel rod a, fig. 5 and 4? whose opposite end, which also has its pivot, rolls in the dial plate. This pivot is terminated by a square suitable for receiving the nose of a watch key, and extends somewhat beyond the surface of the dial between the circle, in which the hours are inscribed, and that in which the minutes are, and precisely between twelve. and sixty, fig. 1. As the pendulum is suspended from this rod by a tang, one end of which passes through the thickness of the rod, is stopped there by a knot, and the other passes through the thickness of the cockerel, and is retained there from behind by a knot, we can imagine that if we make this same rod turn to the right or to the left, the silk is wound up on it, the pendulum goes up even slightly, and that the oscillations of this same

---
Page 248 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 28.

pendulum are a little accelerated. If then we turn this rod in an opposite direction, the pendulum being lowered, we will delay the movement.

  Parallel to the steel rod, of which we have just spoken, is a second, whose pivots roll in the plates ee y ff of the movement cage. On this rod are firmly fixed two parts which determine the exhaust. One of these pieces is the one called Anchor, and shown in fig. 9. The two arms of this anchor embrace the escapement wheel, cut in the shape of a ratchet. It will be understood that, if a driving force, such as that of the spring or of a weight, determines the ratchet to turn, and that by the oscillation of the pendulum, the arm AB of the anchor is removed from the center of the ratchet, and leaves the tooth it is retaining, the other arm C, which for the moment is far from the opposite tooth of the ratchet, will enter between two of these teeth, one of which will rest on the bent part: thus the ratchet could only have turned the distance from one tooth to the other. When the pendulum returns, on the other side, and consequently, on the other arm of the anchor, this arm will leave the tooth it is holding: the ratchet will still turn from the distance of one tooth to the other; but the arm A C of the other will meet and grab another tooth, and the ratchet will only have advanced one tooth yet; which will be repeated with each oscillation of the pendulum.

  It is therefore the oscillations of this pendulum which determine the more or less speed in the march of the escape wheel, and we know that this pendulum itself makes its vibrations all the slower, or accelerated, when 'it is more or less long.

  The second part that the anchor rod carries is the fork b, fîg. 3. This fork is fixed very firmly on the stem, a little further than the reach of the pivot. It is bent in two directions, as seen in the figure, in order to be able, by its lower part, to be outside the plate ff, through which it passes, in a notch of sufficient size so that, whatever be the oscillations which it must describe, it cannot strike against the sides of this notch which one sees in b, fig. f The lower part of this fork is bent at a right angle, and split, in this place, in the whole length of the part ô, in which the pendulum passes; thus, if this fork carries it to the right or to the left, by means of the anchor trying to escape from above each tooth of the ratchet, this same pendulum, the length of which determines the isochronism, that is to say - to say legality of time in the oscillations, gives to the escapement this isochronism, which its length determines.

We put at the bottom of the pendulum, a weight which, by its weight, prevents it

---
Page 249 CHAP. VI. Sect. V. Pendulum island movement in ivory.
Pl. 28.

to go too vile; and since this weight must find as little resistance as possible in the air it constantly moves, it has been shaped like a lens, the edges of which cut the air it moves.

  Experience has shown that a pendulum three feet eight and a half lines long, from its point of suspension to the center of the lens, beats the seconds; That is, it makes sixty oscillations in a space of time which divides the hour into sixty parts, which have been called Minutes; we gave the name of Secwaves in each of the sixtieth parts of minutes; but since the length of the pendulum, in order to beat the seconds, requires mathematical precision, and by the most exact measurement, one cannot be sure that one has reached the required length; that a greater or less length, of a quantity invaluable to the eye and to the instruments of division, can vary the number of oscillations of the pendulum, one taps the lower end of the pendulum, and by means of a nut , we raise or lower the lens, as much or as little as it is necessary, so that the pendulum gives the number of oscillations which is appropriate to regulate the rate of all the cogs, and consequently the division of the day in twenty -four hours.

  It is not possible to make this little clock beat seconds; and what we have said in this regard was only intended to establish the rules of the movement of these kinds of machines. We will therefore give, in this case, and with the numbers of wheels and pinions, to the pendulum, six inches eleven lines, from its point of suspension to the center of the lens. It will make eight thousand three hundred and sixty-two oscillations an hour, and this clock will run thirty-four hours without winding it.

  The calculations of the cogs of any pendulum which marks the minutes are such that the center wheel must make twelve revolutions in twelve hours. The stem of this wheel is long enough to exceed the surface of the dial, it carries a barrel called Chaussée, and this barrel carries a pinion of twelve, fig. 5, which meshes with a wheel of thirty-six, which carries a pinion of ten, which in turn meshes with a wheel of forty, which wheel is mounted on a barrel which spins freely on the roadway, and carries the hour hand, while the end of the roadway, which is square, carries the minute hand.

  As the road rubs a little hard on the stem of the center wheel, and carries the minute hand, it is possible, without inconvenience, and without disturbing the movement, to turn this hand.

---
Page 250 TURNERS MANUAL,
Pl. 28.

and consequently the roadway on the right or on the left, to put it on time. It will suffice to turn the minute hand to the right or to the left, until, by the correspondence it has with the barrel which carries the hour hand, and which is gently rubbed, this hand marks sixty, and that of the hours marks what it is.

  It takes a long time for us to pretend to give sufficient notions here to build a clock. We only wanted to describe the movement of the one we saw; and as long as an amateur has dexterity, knowledge in the construction of machines; as he applies what we have said to the composition and structure of his own watch, we have no doubt that he cannot manage to build this one. Besides, we cannot hide from ourselves that the very nature of the material we propose to use there is an obstacle to never having a very exact clock. If metals are sensitive to hot and cold, how much more, will ivory be susceptible to impressions of drought and humidity? But still, if you give the construction all the necessary attention, you can get a part that works fairly regularly.

  Those who want to go deeper into the theory of clocks can consult the excellent treatises we have on this subject. The Treatise on Watchmaking, by Ferdinand Berthoud, printed in Paris, in 1760, is the best, and has served us in several circumstances, to build machines which have only the principles of the commons, with watches or clocks.

  Our readers may be curious about ways to calculate the duration of the movement of a cog; and to make ourselves more intelligible, we will adapt the rules that we are going to establish to the very pendulum that occupies us.

  To calculate the duration of the movement of a cog, we will first write, on the same line, the number of wings of each of the gears in the order they fit in the cage, and starting with that of the escape wheel. We will then write in the second line, but with a sufficient distance to insert between these two lines a third, of which we will speak in a moment, the numbers of the wheels corresponding to the pinions in which they mesh; so that each number of sprocket wings is greater than the number of teeth of the corresponding wheel. We will divide each number of teeth by the number of wings of each pinion, and we will put each quotient on a line between the

---
Page 251 CIIAP. VI. Skct. V. Pendulum movement in ivory.
Pl. 28.

two previous ones, so that these quotiens are in a perpendicular line with the numbers of wings and teeth. We will write between each column of figures, and on the line of quotians, the sign x, which in mathematics, indicates a multiplication to be done. Let's apply this to our pendulum.

  We see from the table above that the number of teeth of the wheel which meshes with a pinion is put below the number of wings of this same pinion. The middle line which we have named that of the exponents, contains the quotiens of the number of teeth of the wheels, by that of the wings of the pinions which these wheels lead. These quotients express the number of revolutions made by the pinions by each revolution of the wheel which leads it: they are called exponents, a term of convention in this species of calculation, since in mathematics, the word exponent signifies the power to which an amount has been high. The escapement wheel is placed among the exponents which are preceded by the number two, because the pendulum makes two oscillations by each tooth of the rocliet or escapement wheel; one on the right and one on the left. All exponents are separated by the sign x, which means multiplied by. If we multiply all the exponents, one by the other, we will have the number of oscillations that the pendulum makes during an entire revolution of the wheel at which we have stopped; thus, during a whole revolution of the rocliet or escape wheel 14, the pendulum makes twenty-eight oscillations, during a whole revolution of the small medium wheel 60, the pendulum makes two hundred and ten oscillations, because twenty-eight, number found , multiplied by the exponent 7½, gives two hundred and ten, and so on.

  In order to prevent, as far as possible, the effect which all materials, both animal and vegetable, have when they enter into the composition of some machine, it is advisable to give them all the time necessary so that they can no longer torment themselves, as the workers say, or at least let them torment themselves as little as possible.

  We shall therefore begin by sketching very roughly, and very far from their exact measurement, each of the pieces which are to compose the clock;

the three Plates d d, e e, f f, fig.3, the dimensions of which can be taken from the figure itself; the pillars, three in number, a, b, c, fig. 2, whose exact length, between their spans <2, b, fig. 7, will be the distance between the two plates ee, ff, of the cage of the movement, fig. 3; two other pillars, fig.6, the length of which, not including the tenons, will be the distance of the two plates d d, e e, of the quadrature cage; the five wheels 66, 64,62,60 and i4 if g- 2 5 because the barrel must be made separately. Each of these wheels may be taken in rounds on the elephant's tooth, or lengthwise, depending on the grain, and so that there are several on the diameter; and although it seems that the teeth which will be made there must be more solid, if they are taken in small boards, according to the length of the tooth, we think that taken in wheels, they will be less subject to torment, or that 'they will vary more equally. They will be cut out much thicker and larger than they need to be; and it is understood that most of the pieces in question here, having to be either toothed or hollowed out, it is of the greatest necessity that the ivory be perfectly sound, and without the slightest cracking, which would not fail to declare themselves after work. It follows from what we have just advised to take the wheels by wheels, that one should not think of taking the rods and the pinions in the same piece as the wheels. The rods will be taken along the length of the tooth, so that they are more solid. We take the gears in the same direction as the wheels.

  In order to decrease friction, and consequently so that the pendulum could be adjusted with more exactitude, it would be more advantageous to take the stems of the wheels in small yards of steel of suitable size. We would have by this means the faculty of raising smaller pivots, and consequently which will undergo less friction. We will even advise to plug all the holes in the plates with copper plugs, and to drill the holes of these same pivots, as well as of all the parts which must move.

  When we have debited all the parts that go into the composition of the clock, we will pierce them in the center of a hole approaching the size it should have, and we will put them in a drawer or box, where they are not. not suddenly struck by the fresh air, so that they do not become too veiled, or that they do not split. We will leave them there for a while, and we will remove them little by little, so that the impression becomes more imperceptible. The advice we give here should not stop the Artist in his work. There are so many pieces in this clock that we can

do this before dealing with the cogs, which they will have plenty of time to dry. The little edifice which bears the clock can pleasantly occupy the Amator during this time. We have already said it elsewhere, we can make the columns in open torsos, and put the ebony core there: the capitals and bases in solid ivory: the ebony cornice, and the vases which surmount it in ivory; on this distribution, everyone can consult their go lives.

  There is shown separately, FIG. G and 7, the pillars that join the plates, and form what is called the Cage. We will shoot them with care. As for the two small pillars, we formed a thread at one of their ends. This is how they attach to the thickness of the dial plate; which is infinitely more convenient than pinning them, since the dial can be traced on the plate itself. These pillars are pinned by their other end, and those of the cage by both ends: we see the holes in fig. G and 7.

  We will therefore assume that all the ivory pieces have been given time to take effect. They will be shot on their own center, on a Watchmaker's Lathe, and on the bow. This method is infinitely safer than the Tour in the air, for parts that require perfect roundness. We will first grow all the holes in the center, with a squarer, and we will bring them to the size they should be; that is, the one where we put the stems. These rods must be of steel, made on the Bow lathe, and be put at six or eight sides, at the place where they must bear the wheel: we will even make them a little pyramidal in this place, so crude the wheel sits more firmly on it. The same will be done for the pinions, which will be drilled in the center, and which will then be turned on a shaft of a smaller diameter than the part of the rod where it will also have to enter a little by force. When each wheel and its pinion are mounted on their stem, we will turn them one and the other, with care, with the bow: we will form at each end a pivot larger than it should be; but care will be taken that the two shoulders of these pivots are at such a distance from each other that they enter just, but freely, between the two plates where they should be.

  When all the wheels have been prepared and roughed out on suitable shafts, straight and well centered, which, by always removing a little material, and correcting the parts which are warped, contributes to their drying perfectly, and brings them imperceptibly to the point of accuracy where they should be, we will give them to split by joining to

each on a small piece of paper, or by writing on it in pencil how many teeth they should have.

  People who have a divisor, with many numbers, on their lathe, may very well split these wheels themselves. It will suffice to adapt, on a wedge made on purpose, a sort of reel carrying strawberries, the shaft of which, caught between two dolls by its points, turns by means of a bow. It will just be a question of finding a way to advance the reel and the bur imperceptibly towards the center of the wheel, and so that the bur does not penetrate more, before one than the other tooth. One could also advantageously use the tool holder of the cart support, or at least the idea provided by the construction of this support. We just tell Amateurs what is possible to keep quiet; and we would write a very long article if we wanted to go into greater detail.

  When all the wheels are split, we must carefully round the teeth: we say round, because that is the accepted expression; and yet the teeth of the cogs must not present the semicircular shape: it is a curve with several centers, which is detailed in the most satisfactory manner in the work of Thiout, in that of De Lalande, and in that de Berthoud, PL 21. For a number of years, a machine for rounding the teeth has been imagined and executed; and the Amateurs will be able to find in the big cities, of these machines, and to make round the cogs, as big as small. However, in gear teeth with a small diameter, they can be rounded so that the curve is slightly elongated. The sprockets should have their wings clear towards the center, so that the teeth do not engage with them, and they can enter and exit them effortlessly. It will suffice to consider with a magnifying glass the teeth and pinions of a fairly executed watch. We will be careful not to give here the construction of the tool for rounding the teeth: this would throw us far too far from our object. Suffice it to say that it is built on the same principles as the splitting machine; only soft files, which move parallel to the axis of the wheels, and which are mounted on a part thatn move the center of the wheel at will, so that it can suit all diameters, give each tooth the shape that the gauge on which the files slide; and that, since the spacing of these files from the center of the wheel is invariably fixed, the wheel is by the same operation finished and perfectly rounded. If anyone was tempted to round off

Pl. 28.

itself, a toothing on the Lathe in the air, especially a rather strong toothing cpie small, it would suffice to adapt to the support, in place of the cage, two parallel plates of sheet metal or steel; to place the chair in front of the wheel, that is to say the Tour; to build these plates so that the wheel passed between two; to give on these two plates to a tooth which one would form there the shape which it should have; to use on a grinding wheel, about G, 8 or 10 lines towards each end of a soft and round file, three inches long, and to slide on the plates, the worn parts of this file, in order to that it does not bite, and consequently does not change the shape which has been given to the tooth, on the two parallel plates. We would pass all the teeth successively, and we would be assured of their regularity; but it would be necessary that the divider which is on the Lathe contains all the numbers of the various wheels.

  We can imagine that from this idea we could make a splitting machine, by placing the cutter above each wheel.

  To make the barrel, we will choose a piece of ivory of sufficient size, so that we can find the diameter it should have, without any crack or parish cracking around the circumference. Take the wheel with sixty-eight teeth, which seems to be attached to it, from the piece: the thickness of this wheel will form the bottom of the barrel. Its diameter will protrude from that of the barrel to all the depth you need to give the teeth, and even a little deeper it will be hollowed out to the thickness of the wheel. We will give about a line and a half thickness at the sides: we will make on this thickness a rebate capable of containing just a small plate which must be flush with it when closing the barrel. It is customary to make, with a triangle or hinged file, a notch on the field of this cover, in order to be able to provide space with a steel point, when it is necessary to touch the spring.

  One can hardly claim to make this spring oneself. This operation involves too many details and difficulties, and requires a great deal of practice.

  A spring must be everywhere equal in thickness, that it should neither be too thin nor too thick, that it be soaked and returned equally everywhere: which is very difficult.

  In watches, Art has made up for the unequal force in a spring by means of the rocket. This fuse is a kind of truncated cone, on which the chain coming from the barrel is wrapped: when the spring is in all its force, that is to say, when the watch has just been wound up, we can see that the the effort of this spring, on all the cogs, would be too much

---
Page 256 TURNERS MANUAL,
Pl. 28.

big; and that when it is almost fully developed, this effort would be almost nil: this is how the invention of the rocket remedies this inequality of tension. When the spring is in full force, the chain is on the smallest part of the spindle; and consequently he acts on it by a very short lever. When, on the contrary, the spring is at the end, the chain is on the largest diameter of this spindle, and it acts on the cogs, by a much longer lever; thus, one compensates, very ingeniously, and by insensible degrees, the successive diminution of the tension of the spring. We didn't put a rocket here, because the part looks more like a clock than a watch. But, to make up as much as possible for the unequal tension of the spring, the barrel is made a little high, and as large as possible, for the place it must occupy: there is puts a very long spring, and we hardly use anything but intermediate turns, between the beginning and the end of its tension: if therefore the barrel makes fifteen or eighteen turns, when the spring is banded, one does not count for nothing, neither the first four, nor the last four. It may be surprising to learn that, in a medium-sized pendulum, the spring is six feet long and sometimes more.

  When all the pieces have been prepared and brought close to their dimensions, we will turn with care, and we will set up the two plates ee, ff, fig. 3. We will turn the three pillars; and it is of the greatest importance that they are equal in length, between the shoulders a, b, fig. 7, so that the two plates are perfectly parallel. Carefully mark all the pivot holes and drill them. If we want to bring consistency to the last point, and ensure, as much as possible, of the equalconstant friction, we will make these holes larger than necessary; we will just plug them with good brass, and we will make the holes for the pivots. When the wheels are shaved, which are finished, we give on the Tour to the bow, the last blow to the pivots, which we polish with care.

  The minute carriage and the hour barrel must be drilled straight, rounded with a squarer, and turned perfectly round, so that turning one on the other there is no more friction in one part than in the 'other, the wheels must turn freely, and without tossing, both between the plates and in the pivot holes. When we assemble the piece to make it fit, we will put, with a pin, a small drop of excellent purified olive oil.

  We see in fig. 4 the shape that we must give to the rooster which carries the

---
Page 257 CHAP. VI- Sect. V. Pendulum movement in ivory.
Pl. 28.

pendulum or pendulum, and we see in fig. 3, the projection that it must have. We will fix the rooster to the plate by means of two screws, as can be seen. But, as in the construction of the part in which we are dealing, we are obliged to mount and remove the screws often, and we risk quickly wearing out the pitches of the nuts, made in ivory, we will take care that the pitches, both of the screws and of the nuts, are sharp and very smooth.

  No matter how much care you take to set the pendulum straight, you cannot be sure of perfect accuracy. If we deviated from it, the pendulum would no longer be in the vertical line, if it were contained in a notch roughly just on the fork b. This is so that this pendulum can take the vertical line, that instead of a notch which allows the square part g to pass freely, we split the fork in the entire length of the return of the square b. Thus, if the pendulum tilted forward or backward, the pendulum would still have the ability to be in the vertical line, and to move away or closer to the line of the plates.

  The small square piece of copper g, through which the rod of the balance wheel crosses, which is nothing more than a small rod of steel half a line in diameter or approximately, serves to prevent the lens from moving in a other direction than that of its plan.

  The minute hand enters square at the end of the road; and therefore whenever it is rotated, the pavement also rotates; but as we have seen that this roadway rubs against the rod of the center wheel, we can imagine that it can be made to turn, to the right or to the left, without this wheel being disturbed. And as the roadway carries a pinion 12, fig. 5, which meshes with a wheel 36, same figure, which in turn carries a pinion which meshes with the Zjo wheel, which is on the barrel on which the hour hand is attached to friction, we feel that the movement of the minute hand must drive the hour hand without disturbing the movement of the cog inside the cage.

  If you wanted to add a ringtone to this room, you would have to adjust its layout before starting anything; we recommend, in this case, to consult some good Horlogerie Treatise, and particularly that of Berthoud, which leaves nothing to be desired in this regard.

  The whole machine rests on the piece of architecture which serves as its pedestal, by the plates d, f-, fig. - 3. These two plates rest on the part that we have made more particularly sensitive, fig. 8, which is nothing other than the base A. This part offers at its upper part a square or rather a parallelogram, the width of which is indicated by the line o, b, and whose

---
Page 258 TURNER'S MANUAL.
Pl. 28.

length is equal to the distance between the two plates d, f This parallelgram is followed by a fluted part A, carried by a square C; a tenon d. fig.8, brings everything together in the architectural piece.

  To cpie the stages can rest on the part, f / g. 8, it is necessary that it be hollowed out circularly, following the external shape of the plates, which, otherwise, would only touch it at one point. We see, fig.1, that the base A is hollowed out to carry the dial.

  As the balance or pendulum, is, by its position, placed behind the plate of the movement, it is evident that it does not move in the center of the circle on which the columns are placed; and that in this way it is possible to place in the center some figure which makes ornament. We had an eccentric piece represented there, which we will teach how to do by talking about the eccentric machine.

  We can put at the kind of small temple which serves as a support for the pendulum three or four columns at will. The one who served us as a model only had three, in order, no doubt, to discover more of the room which was in the center: but it seems to us that this number is not sufficient, and does not agree well with the rules of architecture, where everything must be symmetricalue. Moreover, it is a matter of taste; and each can follow his own.

  We believe that we have said enough to get the Amateurs to build this charming piece, where you have to bring together many kinds of industry: but we feel that the details into which we have entered are not sufficient for those who have not. other knowledge on the construction of clocks. A Treaty of Watchmaking should have been drawn up, and this task did not suit the work we undertook, nor even our strengths and our knowledge. We have executed various parts of mechanics and watchmaking; and in spite of this we have often needed to have recourse to the authors who have dealt with this matter. We repeat: if someone is tempted to undertake such a pendulum, and even to build one, with the metals in use, he will find in Berthoud's work all the details of theory and practice of which they will have. need.

* PART SIX. COMPOUND TOURS.
* FIRST CHAPTER. Chucks; Cart supports.

THIS part being entirely devoted to the description of compound tricks and their effects, we thought it necessary, to always follow the same approach, to precede it with a summary table of the main parts which we are going to deal with, followed by the description of the supports with trolley.

Most of these machines require that the shaft be drilled in its entire length, and this is what has prompted us to give in this preliminary chapter, the manner of drilling a lathe shaft, and of polishing the inside of the hole .

Fig.1,Pl. 29, represents a workbench on which is a Tower in the air, at the end of the tree of which is the creeper which we will speak of later. pL. 29. Nothing was put on the nose of the tree, so as not to confuse this figure, which is already very busy. We see that the Tour is led by. 33.

a wheel placed above the workbench, which is essential to obtain the effects of crawling and guilloche. The endless rope, crossed, passes over the Tour pulley. The step, or pedal B, turns, by means of a rope 6, the fly wheel H, which is on the same shaft as those, On a flat face of a parallelelipiped Z), taken from a large piece of wood, the bottom of which has the shape of a column E, is a CCC iron frame, in which slides, with a dovetail, a copper cover e e, which carries bearings, between which the collars of the l the shaft which carries the two wheels. A round head screw d, whose threads take in a bulge made in the bottom crosspiece of the CCC frame, raises and lowers the yoke e e, to give the appropriate tension to the endless rope a.

On the wheel A, whose diameter is approximately half that of the fly wheel /Z, are two or three of different diameters, to be able to slow down the movement of the Tour; which is very necessary in certain cases, as we will see for creeping rosettes, and even more particularly in the guilloche lathe. We see behind the Tower, on the left, the doll F, which carries the key or roulette.

We also see, on the workbench, the trolley support, the details of which we will give in one of the sections of this chapter, and which is represented in large, Pl.31: it is shown here mounted on a sole and chair of drink. We also represented the two dolls with points and the one with glasses. The piece of iron which is applied to the front headstock of the Tour en l'air is used to fix, on this headstock, the English oval. This is what we will call 1 efer-dc-heval in the description of this coin. It also receives the ring of the epicycloid, which we will describe in its place.

Fig.2 represents the knife doll, which is used to make the screws and torsos that we have spoken about. We see here how the two pieces of which it is composed fit together. The C post enters into a renovation made at the base. At the top of this base is a copper circle, which bears an index b, used to mark the inclination of the knife, to the right or to the left, by means of the divisions which are on a similar copper circle, at the bottom of the part B. The dotted line shows how the screw which fixes the headstock to the workbench, by taking into the nut a, at the same time fixes the knife at the inclination that has been determined.

Fig.3 represents the copper cylinder which is mounted on the lathe to make the torso: it has three threads: the one a of which we see the beginning, and which follows the simple punctuated line and reappears at a a; the second b b, which passes from behind, follows the double punctuated line, and reappears at b; finally the third c c, which, by two punctuated lines, passes from behind.

Fig.4 is what we call the Oval Ring: the Jlg. 5 is the English oval tray, furnished with its slides and the slide which slides between. We will detail the composition and playing of this interesting piece elsewhere.

Fig.6 is a vice chuck, which is mounted on the nose of the shaft by a nut made in the bulge a. By means of the two screws b b, one of which is on the left and the other on the right, the two jaws c c, sliding on the rules d d, between which they are contained by friction, approach and move apart the one from the other, always in equal quantities; in this way the piece they have grasped is always centered. A is the crank used to turn the screws.

Fig.7 is the four-jaw universal mandrel, described in the first Volume, page 287. This mandrel is very convenient for re-nutting a wood mandrel, the hole of which has narrowed, or for any other part which we do not want to immandulate, or whose center is not in the center of the figure. If it is a round part on the outside, we take it from the inside of the jaws: if it is round on the inside, like the lid of a box outside which we want to work, we take it from the inside, spreading the jaws towards the circumference of the board. The four screws b 3 b,b,b, moved by the key C, bring the jaws closer to the center, or move them away from it, depending on whether they are turned to the left or to the right. When you want to center a part that is already round, you place it flat on the table, at an equal distance all around, from the edges, and you tighten the jaws. We put everything on the Lathe, and if we notice that the part is not turning correctly, we slightly divert the screw opposite the side which advances too much, and we turn the screw to that side. When the piece is close to being round, and we no longer notice to the eye which side is the eccentricity, we present a pencil to the piece, and by turning it, the protruding part is marked with a slight line which is brought in by pushing in the screw a little, and loosening the opposite one.

If the eccentricity was not against any of the four screws, but between two, it would be necessary to loosen the two opposite screws, and tighten the other two. A little practice and experience will make it possible to center a part in this chuck with great precision. 

Fig.8 is a mandrel with pads, in the center of which a square or round piece of steel or copper is gripped. In a long square opening, made on the front face of the mandrel, slide the two bearings a a, behind which support two screws, the square heads of which are embedded in the thickness of the mandrel, which, like the previous one, is mounted on the Lathe in the air, by means of a bulge which is supposed to be behind. When you want to turn a bearing on a somewhat long iron or steel rod, you pass it through the hole made in the shaft, and you fix the rod by means of two bearings. When we want to make a series of pearls on a copper rod, we place this rod in the inside of the tree, leaving only what is necessary to come out of the mandrel to make a pearl. The rod is held in place by the two cushions which we loosen, when we want to move it forward, to form another pearl and so on. During this operation, the beads made are held in a channel fixed at the height of the center, either by the support or by a doll on the right.

Fig.9 is a double eccentric. It is called double 3 because it offsets a piece in two directions at right angles, like A and B.

There are simple eccentrics, which only eccentric the piece in one direction, but in order not to multiply the figures, we have represented the one which eccentrics it in two directions: this needs explanation, which will be found below after in the description of the eccentric, PL 37.

Fig.10 is a split mandrel. Its use is very convenient for various tower works. Have we finished and polished a piece like a case, to which we want to put circles of tortoiseshell or ivory, or put back one that has been broken; if we put it on the lathe in a chuck, by the ordinary method, we would risk breaking it, or at least spoiling it, by forcing it with blows of a mallet into a chuck, to make it hold there securely . We turn a wooden chuck, four to six inches long; a little conical towards the end. We split it along its length by two saw cuts, at right angles up to the groove, or clearance a: we put it on the Lathe, and we dig it to a diameter such that the piece enters easily: we put the work in the chuck; then, placing the ring on the mandrel, we push it in with small blows of the mallet all around. The springy wood, because of the conical shape of the mandrel, and the saw cuts, tightens the work without damaging it, and allows it to be turned as desired.

If the piece was very polished, and there was a fear that the pressure of the

--- Page 263 CHAP. I. Sect. I. Table of the different Parts, etc.
Pl.29.

mandrel spoils it, we can wrap it in a playing card, which would be very gentle on it.

Part C of the chuck is cylindrical and receives 1 nut for the nose of the arbor. The clearance is used to weaken the wood in this place, so that it produces a softer spring.

If the piece is not centered, we will insert the ring a little obliquely; practice will soon learn to center these kinds of parts.

It is good to have these kinds of mandrels, of several diameters, to place parts of all sizes; and then you have to have as many rings as you have types of mandrels. Thus we can have five or six of two inches, for the smallest objects, up to fifteen or eighteen lines: as many as four inches for pieces, from fifteen lines to three inches, and as many as six inches for snuff boxes and other objects of larger diameter.

It should also be observed that, as these mandrels are very hollow, and the saw cuts isolate the fibers of the wood, they are very prone to twisting, especially if they are caught in heartwood; it is necessary each time they are used, to put them back in order, both internally and externally. The ring must have noticeably more entry on one side than the other, because of the conical shape of the mandrel, otherwise there would only be the angle on the side of the lathe which would press against the mandrel. .

Fig.11 is a pigtail chuck, described on page 279 of the TI.

Fig.12 is a tumbler chuck which is filled with a plug of good round turned wood, and which enters it by force. By this means, when we put a part on the Lathe, and push it in with a little force, we do not have to fear that the chuck will break, as often happens. You need to have several sizes.

Fig.13 is a kind of infinitely convenient mandrel. It is pierced in the center with a square hole, as seen in a, above. We place wicks ^ B there, which we have shown next to it; squares, some other tools, which, moved by the turn in the air, produce a much more rapid effect than if they were moved by a crankshaft. We see along the length of this mandrel a square notch, into which a key is inserted to push the tool out of its place.

We removed from this chuck the pressure screw which fixed the bits, because it threw them aside, and prevented them from turning.

--- Page 264 TURNERS MANUAL.  Pl.29.

along their axis. It is enough that the hole and the square of the bit are a little pyramidal.

We have only represented fig.14 and 15 here to satisfy the curiosity of our readers in advance. This is the epicycloid machine, and all the parts that make it up, both in place and separately.

We will subsequently develop in a specific article both this definition and the means of producing this curve, which has a very pleasant and above all very varied effect.

Fig.17 is the chuck with cup and eight screws, described on page 289 of T. I.

Fig.18 is the four-screw doll chuck. The figure clearly indicates its form and use.
