# Bergeron Translation

Bergerons book is one of the most important references to the history of turning. It is from a time when it was possible for an individual[^1] to build a "state of the art" machine just from the raw materials, and if that is your wont then it is essential reading. It is also in French...

There is a historic translation of Volume 1 available here [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/turnersmanualbe00berggoog) but pages 9-74 are missing. This is probably a fault in the digitization, but no other copy is currently available.

## Phase one
is to translate these missing pages from the French original also available here: [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/manueldutourneu00hamegoog)
The OCR scan is not perfect so in order to get a machine translation, first that needs to be cleaned up. 

## Phase two
is to complete the translation of [Volume 2](https://archive.org/details/manueldutourneur02berg_0)

## Phase three
is to arrange the whole thing with all the plates in the right places so it can be printed or viewed as a pdf. Some plates are missing in the historic translation, although all are available separately in the [Atlas du Manuel du Tourneur](https://archive.org/details/manueldutourneurberg)

[^1]: Many of those that did lost their heads to the guillotine, but that's a whole nother story.
