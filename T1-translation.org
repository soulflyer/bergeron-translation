** CHAPTER 1 Des Bois
*** SECTION II Des Bois de France

Hornbeam must be well chosen to be good. The one that grows in damp soils is greasy, cottony or without consistency. It is whiter than the others; but this very whiteness is a sign by which we recognize it as being less good. The Hornbeam turns perfectly. Its pores, without being tight, are very fine: but by the very fact that they are loose, it is subject to splitting, unless it is partially dry. When it is still fresh, we make excellent screws of medium size, the threads of which cut very sharply and very cleanly. The tenons that we make for Hornbeam works are not safe, unless they have a certain size; They also make excellent mallets for the lathe and for carpentry, especially if you choose a knotty part. It is with this wood that cabinetmakers veneer the white squares of common checkerboards: the others are made with holly. We also make white fillets for marquetry. Finally, except for carpentry in buildings, wheelwrights and furniture, Hornbeam can be used for an infinity of pleasant works, with the choice that we have recommended.

THE ordinary WALNUT, fig. 7, is a tree common to almost all the provinces of France, and of the greatest utility in the arts. It comes very high and very big. He does not like in forests; he asks to be isolated, either on the main roads or in the fields. There are few woods as bonding as Walnut. It also supports tenon and mortise well. Furniture made from this wood is much stronger than that of concrete. It turns perfectly. It takes a fairly nice polish, either on the lathe or on the plane. As it produces tables of great width, your coach carpenters make car panels of the largest size from it. We turn it over the fire, following the curve of the box, heating it on one side and wetting it on the other. Before rosewood and acajon were so common in Europe, walnut was the wood from which the most precious furniture was made. It is true that then we commonly had Walnut full of veins and accidents which we opposed symmetrically, and which had the most beautiful effect, especially when on a gray-brown background, we saw large, almost black veins: but luxury, having multiplied the enjoyments, we hastened to cut down the trees before they had acquired, through age, this color and these veins which highlighted their beauty: today almost all the walnut trees are gray and barely veined. The sample shown in the figure is of this species; but our sole aim was that we could recognize the wood by its general characteristics, and especially by the grain or the bark. If the Walnut were more compact and harder than it is, it would be the king of the woods; but, in this case, the tenons would not be as solid, since their very compactness makes them brittle.

When the Walnut is reversed, as the workers say, or when it is wavy, it must be worked with a toothed plane, a standing plane or a two-iron plane.

Fig. 8 represents another species of Walnut, which grows particularly in Auvergne, and which must be preferred because it is the most beautiful, and rarely attacked by worms. The black veins that we see there are not accidents like in the old Walnut tree that we are talking about: they are its constituent characteristics. Its nature, its properties, are absolutely the same as those of the previous one. So, for such a slight difference, we will not stop to give a further description.

THE ASH TREE, fig. 9, is a large and superb forest tree, whose leaves closely resemble those of the elderberry or the yebule. The uses to which it is employed in the arts are quite good; but, as a reward, they are of the greatest importance. As this wood is the most binding of all, it never breaks sharply, but sorts for a long time before breaking, we make an infinity of works from it in which this property is extremely valuable. It is with duFi^e that we make strong axles for many cars which transport heavy Êudeaux. They are made into stretchers for carriage trains, post-chaises and cabriolets, chairs (and they are the best), excellent hammer handles, saw arms, and finally very high, very small ladders. , and yet very-s<Jides. Its bark is subject to being bitten by worms; but it is rare that they enter the wood. It is approximately the same colors as that of the hornbeam; but the latter is quite plain, whereas that of the Ash is a sort of rib. Ash is quite a beautiful white, not very dense: it takes stain well. It turns well and planes poorly: so we never use it in carpentry. To give, in a single word, a fair idea of ​​the strength and binder of the Ash, it is enough for us to say that, when the two corner stones of the pediment of the new Church of Sainte-Geneviève arrived, by water, at the port des Invalides, and it was a question of transporting them to their destination, the first was dragged by capstans, which lasted about three days and three nights: we did not dare put it on any car. Finally, for the second, a hand truck was built, made of a very large frame, armed in all directions with iron bars, and rolling on hubs, two feet or so in diameter, in place of wheels: the two axles There were two ash trees, and the ard was drawn by sixty-three horses. From this we will judge the enormity of the stone, and its weight. These axles were so little tired, that some time later the same car was used to transport the drone which had just been melted for the same Church, from the place where it was melted, to the Church for the beiùr, and then bring it back to the bottom of the tower.

THE CHESTNUT TREE, Fig. 1 Pl. 2, is a purely forest tree; we see few around Paria that have acquired a certain size and height; but there are several provinces of France where it comes with the greatest beauty. This wood was once widely used for framing. It is claimed that worms and spiders do not attack it. All the attics of ancient monuments are made of this wood; or it is no longer used in Paris, probably because we have neglected its cultivation in high forests, because we find a lot of it there. coppice, and even of medium size in forests. The caterpillars almost never attack it: so the Chattaigniers are always furnished with their leaves. Its wood is very bondable. It even seemed, at least as much as the ash tree. It would be desirable that we try to use it for chairs, instead of alder, which is used in common places, for no other reason than its lightness. It is true that being a little wave of pain, it took the dye less well than ash, which is very white. This wood is used very little in the arts; and, as it is not allowed to grow for more than five or ten years, it is used very usefully to make excellent hoops, weaving and other objects of little consequence.

THE WILLOW, fig. 2, is almost of no use in the arts. There is no one who does not know it on its feet, to enjoy itself at the edge of the bushes, in aquatic and low places: its branches, which are cut every two years, give good use hoops; but they are not worth the chestnut. We also make stakes in certain provinces, in the absence of other wood; but, as this wood is very soft, it rots quickly in the ground.

In the absence of personal praise for this wood, we will report a use for which it is particularly intended in certain places. The stones, from which millstones are made, need to be of approximately constant thickness: here is how we manage to give them this dimension. We form, in the quarry, a column as high as the bench allows; then, with special tools, we surround this column in as many places and circularly as we want to find millstones there. When this groove is 6 or 8 lines deep, the millstones are separated in such an ingenious way that it deserves the admiration of the man educated in physics and the observing philosopher.

We cut willow into strips, 1 inch or 18 lines long: we keep the children busy making thousands of corners; they are dried for a long time, but at a moderate heat, in an oven; then, with small mallets, we fill all the grooves that we have made in the column throughout its height, very close to each other; then, with a pump or otherwise, we water the column considerably all around, and consequently, the corners with which it is lined. All these corners, eager for humidity, absorb a lot of it, swell, and, acting as levers, cause each division to split into regular pieces, which are as many millstones. We dry these corners again, which are used several times.

THE ASPEN, fig. 3, is included among the white woods, which are not of great use in the arts. We make excellent wood for polishing with emery, tapped, or pulverized sandstone, because being very soft, this emery, or as an ingredient, penetrates its txahee, and forms a species of soft lime which polishes very well. Hard wood, and especially of uneven density, is less good, because the emery, entering less into the wood, presents to the piece being polished, more hardness, and consequently, is subject to scratching.

Once again, we will somewhat avenge Aspen for its apparent uselessness, by saying that it is the only wood that shoemakers use to screw ankles into heels; hard wood, as it dries, would leave its place, whereas wood that is so tender, swells considerably, perishes from the slightest humidity, and still holds up well. A distinguished artist in the arts, the late Dom Bedos, author of The Organ Maker, and an excellent Gnomonic, had taught us a very simple way to iron razors, which was a perfect success for us.

We form a kind of razor leather from Aspen wood, having its
two surfaces a little behind a donkey. We coat both with fine grease, such as ointment: or sprinkle them with water emery, of the finest finesse, and we thus supplement the use of razor stones. which, however fine they may be, do not sharpen fine enough. We can assure that, by this means, the same razor held us tight for more than four years in a row, and that at the end, the curvature, which the grindstone gives to the blade, was almost entirely erased. Razor leathers are nothing more than powder, which serves to sharpen the edge; but when you press the razor on the leather, it necessarily makes this leather, which is soft, give way, which gives the edge a curved shape on each side, instead of wood, which does not give way, retaining the two surfaces of the razor well flat, and consequently, gives a more acute angle than the union of two curves.

THE BIRCH, fig. 4. is still among the white woods, and is used for the same purposes. It is a little harder than aspen: we know of few uses to which it is employed in the arts. Its branches, the. smaller, used to make brooms; and a custom that we hope to see disappear, causes unthinking parents to use its branches to imprint wisdom on their children.

ALDER, fig. 5, is still among the white woods, but its use is quite extensive in the arts. The turners, in common works, make chairs, stools, small beds for the children; and as this tree grows very high, and runs very straight and very small, ladders are made of the greatest height, such as 30 to 40 feet: the two heights are so flexible that when we see a man there going up, one cannot help but feel a feeling of fear for one's life, seeing it swing considerably. Masons also make eco-poles to scaffold houses and rise to the greatest height. We also make some small tower works.

THE LIME TREE, fig. 6, is still a white wood: it is known in gardens by. the shade it provided, early in the spring. Its flower, taken as an infusion, is an excellent emmenagogue. Its wood is soft, but it is used for different works for which the others are not suitable. It is a little more compact, and as it cuts quite cleanly, we make sticks of it to be gilded, and especially sculpture. It is not very prone to knots: it therefore works quite well with a plane, and is very pleasant to turn. It is cut into long, thin shavings which are used to make women's hats known as "chapeaux de paille blanche'.

The CHERRY TREE, fig. 7, which is confused with cherry, because they both have the same texture and the same bark, is a wood that turns very well, although a little soft to be used in large quantities. carpentry. We nevertheless make very pleasant pieces of furniture from it, particularly chairs, which, when passed through lime water, acquire a brown color, more solid than that of other chair wood which is dyed in all colors, and which change considerably over time. after some time. This tree has this singularity, that the bark, instead of being lengthwise like all the others, is crosswise, and seems to hold the wood in a kind of prison which opposes its growth. Also the people of the countryside, who have cherry trees, and who want to give them a faster growth, slightly split this bark on the north side, so that the split is not exposed neither to the heat of the south, nor to the rains. from the sunset This split soon increases to the point that the tree itself is, in a few years, split to the heart, and perishes in less than 12 to 15 years: but the wood is sacrificed to production.

THE PLUM TREE, fig. 8, is a tree that everyone knows; but we hardly work except the wild plum tree, that is to say, the one which comes, in the forests, without cultivation and without grafting. It is soft, binding, has fine grain, and works very well with a plane and lathe. As it is pleasantly veined, we can make little jewels from it, both in carpentry and on the Lathe. The bark of this wood is not a sure clue to define it or to recognize it: almost all wild fruit trees have the same bark; and it must be very practiced to recognize them externally. It is only their texture, their fibers, their color, their veins that . distinguish utis from others. We can even say that the Plum tree resembles the elm, by the way in which its veins are laid out, and by their color; but we barely notice its pores, whereas in the elm, they are very sensitive.

THE APPLE TREE, fig. 9, is a tree that grows low. It is prone to rolling, that is to say, twisting on itself, so that its wire is not often straight, which makes it quite difficult to cut with a plane; but, when it is healthy, it is a very pleasant wood to work with. It is hard, binding, tight, resembles the cormier in its redness and its veins. They are made into good carpentry tools of all kinds, and especially molding tools. It also works well on the Tour, and it is already one of those of which we will make a more direct application to the object which concerns us more particularly. When it ages, fairly large and white worms are introduced between the wood and the wood, which eat the intermediate substance, and which sometimes penetrate into the wood. If this ari>re did not have the disadvantage of being rolled and split, we would give it precedence over several others of which we are going to speak, and which are precious for the arts. The engineers of mills and large machines search for it carefully to burn your teeth or light the big wheels, and the rollers of the lanterns.

THE PEAR TREE, fig. 1, Pl. 3, is, in the judgment of workers, artists and amateurs, the most pleasant wood for all the arts. It is soft, binding, without knots or cracks, very smooth, very even, has a fine grain, can be planed, cut and turned in all shapes: it is also used to make models of machines. It is good for wood engraving, and it is it is used by wallpaper and Indian wallpaper manufacturers to make all their designs. It is not very hard, which means that it cannot be used for carpentry tools; but it has so many other qualities that we can easily overlook this slight flaw.

THE MOUNTAIN ASH, fig. 2, is a forest tree, which grows quite high, and which produces alises, a red fruit good to eat. Its bark is a color between that of hornbeam and that of oak. When it is felled and dry, the bark is easily detached from the wood; and as soon as it has passed a winter and a summer, it is advisable to remove it, since large white worms enter it which first eat the intermediate substance, and then introduce themselves as far as in the heart.

This wood seems to us to combine, to the supreme degree, all the qualities that a turner-mechanic can desire for his work. When it is young, it is white, soft to the plane and TdDr, veined almost like walnut, but whiter, and it has incomparably finer pores. When older, it is reddish, acquires hardness, and for this reason, is suitable for all the works for which we want to use it. Soft like pear wood, it planes as well as it does, and turns better, because it is tighter, and it can support fine moldings and pines. This tree grows high enough and big enough for us to have large pieces. We cut it into tables and boards. It is the best of all woods for making screws of all sizes. If the die cuts well, the screw will come out clean and smooth, as if we had taken the trouble to polish it. Black veins of the greatest hardness are often found in the heart.

In Paris, where most of the firewood comes in trains, that is to say, by means of floating, it is quite commonly found in building sites; but something that has been floated loses a little of its quality: and it is even very common, with a beautiful external appearance, to find it heated at the heart. This defect comes from the fact that it was cut out of sap; and, in this case, either the log is pierced furthermore and turns into powder, or else it is lashed with white spots, which take away all its consistency from the wood. But that which comes among new wood is more often good. This wood is extremely sought after. The construction site boys take great care to set it aside to sell it, either in detail, to amateurs, or by the way, and at a very high price, although this sorting is prohibited by municipal police regulations. However, as one would have to buy twenty strips of wood to find seven or eight beautiful logs, sometimes more, and often not one; that besides, it is a shame to burn it, it is necessary that, to provide the means of providing for it, sorting be tolerated.

The Toumenrs also make excellent mandrels for the Tour en l'air; and although some are made from boxwood, which are even harder, the most ordinary use is to take Mountain Ash.

We dwell with complacency on the praise of this wood, because in fact it is the one which brings together the most qualities for all the arts it also takes very well re-brown dyes, like the color of mahogany and others, which we will teach later.

SERVICE TREE, fig. 3, is placed, by some workers, above the aliner, in certain views. It is a forest area which grows quite large, and which produces corms, a type of small wild pear. It must be admitted that Service Tree is harder and taller than Mountain Ash: when it is old, when it is at least a certain size, we find, at the heart of the tree, red-brown veins. , which make it extremely heavy and hard: this is why we make, with this wood, the best menniacry tools, and particularly molding tools which are very useful. But, as it is prone to torment, the carpenters stick to the barrels of oak tools, (this is the body of the tool), small strips of Service Tree, on which they control the profile. molding, and use it as a tool that would be entirely Service tree.

ACACIA, fig. 4, is a very common tree. Naturalists distinguish between two kinds: the true one, which is quite rare, and the false one which they call Pseudo-Acacia, which is very common. Its wood, which is greenish-yellow, is only intended for the Tour. They are made into good bed casters, and mortars for pounding different materials, either in the kitchen or in the pharmacy. We also make pestles from it, and different pieces of tower, such as boxes suitable for wetting the tobacco, the spoon, the small stick which has a ball at one end to mix the tobacco. This wood is fine, soft, quite hard, and polishes very well.

THE DOGWOOD, fig. 5, is a small forest shrub, which rarely acquires more than an inch and a half or 3 inches in diameter, but which, ordinarily, has little more than one. This tree grows quite tall; but it is bristling throughout its length, with an infinity of branches, not very far from each other, which means that we frequently encounter knots that are quite strong, very hard, and. which interrupt the grain of the wood, so that little use can be made of it. It's a shame, no doubt, because it is white, fine, hard, without visible pores, and resembles duhoux in many respects. We make the best hammer handles, cart sides, and excellent rungs from it. It is very^wn to turn for small objects; but if we encounter a knot along the length of the piece, this knot is visible by a small black dot, which is infinitely hard. The fruit of this shrub is called Horn - It is as big as a cherry, and red like it.

THE HOLLY, fig. 6, is the strongest of the shrubs that our forests produce. It is green all year round; its leaves armed with quills, alternately inverted above and below, seem to defend the approach; and yet the wild boars will wallow there with pleasure. This shrub commonly comes as a bush. The skin of the young branches is a very beautiful green, when it is in its sap, and serves to retain the glue. The large branches are spotted with gray and large mossy greens. This wood is very fine, the most beautiful white possible, without visible pores, takes the most beautiful polish; and among other uses, it is used to make the white squares of checkerboards. It contains a large quantity of vegetation water, and retains it for a long time, which means that it takes a long time to dry; but when it has reached parity dryness, it yellows a little, and shrinks a lot. It is difficult to plan, except with a toothed plane, standing or with two irons: but it turns parËiitemeat. When a piece is finished at the Turn, one would be tempted to take it for ivory, because of certain small marks with which this wood is whipped, and which resemble those of ivory which is not very fine. Cabinetmakers make the greatest use of it, because of all the qualities that we have just detailed.

THE THORN, fig. 7, is very common in forests, and especially in hedges; but the one that grows into a tree is less ordinary. It is a very hard wood, less beautiful white than holly. Its grain is also much less fine. It looks quite similar to charm; but it is firmer. It is very bondable, and can be used on an infinity of works that we want to preserve in their whiteness. We see, by its growth, that it is a wild tree. A singularity of this tree is that there are many points and small branches in all directions which interrupt its thread when it is young. All these knots disappear entirely when it becomes large, unlike the common tree which always retains them, at some point. age it reaches.

THE SPINDLE TREE, fig. 8, is a wood which resembles, both in its bark and in its color and texture, French boxwood. It is with this wood that we commonly make the king's feet which we sell so cheaply, and which are only so common because they are marked and graduated, by applying them between two molds or caliln-es, where all the divisions are marked, and which are imprinted in the foot, by means of strong pressure: LeFusain still has a particular property: it is that, if we enclose a stick in a gun barrel, closed hermetically at both ends, with tampons, or with loam, and when we rub the barrel red along its entire length, we remove a spindle tree very suitable for drawing, and which has the property of being erased immediately, and without leaving a trace.

THE BOXWOOD OF FRANCE, fig. 9, is a shrub that does not do well in several of our provinces: it is what we call, in agricultural terms, very stunted, that is to say, very gnarled, twisted “and rarely quite straight. Perhaps these defects come from the fact that no care is taken of it, and that, intended to serve as a hedge as a hedge, we allow it to grow at random, and throw out an infinity of branches from the bottom to top. What grounds this conjecture is that there has long been a Boxwood in the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, which grew to 10 or 12 feet high, and which, having become quite large, appeared to be open. of these frequent knots and this tortuosity which usually characterize it. It is a greenish-yellow color and planes quite poorly; but it turns well. There is no wood that supports the lathe screw as well as boxwood; and as long as the comb cuts well, the screw and nut are of a sharpness and cleanliness that nothing comes close to. As this wood is very hard, excellent mandrels can be made from it, especially those which should only be of mediocre size.

By a very natural consequence, of the fact that the Boxwood comes to France without care and without cultivation, it is ordinary to find excrescences in it {woven from a sap which has been expelled, and which over a long time produces an infinity of small sprigs, which could not produce enough growth to form decided branches. These growths, which we call Loupes, and. which come close to the ground, present natural accidents, sometimes very pleasant. These magnifying glasses, of which we have represented a slice, to give an idea, because of their infinite variety, are perfectly worked on the Tour. They come particularly from Saint-Claude, in Franche-Comté. We give them different dyes, which, insinuating themselves into the pores, or, to put it better, into the intorvaties' which each little eye lets oint its neighbors, and, combined with the yellow color which these burls take from the nature of the Boxwood , have a very good effect. The inhabitants of Saint-Claude send, to Paris, an infinity of works made with magnifying glasses, and put on them a very fine and very hard varnish, which Mr. Hamdin-Bergeron obtained, and of which he is still provided. We will give, in a separate chapter, how to use all the varnishes.

The burls are subject, the moment they have been worked, to reveal cracks or cracks which do not penetrate very far, but which sometimes cross the top or the sides of a boot. We clean these little slots perfectly; we form with a penknife, or otherwise, small corners which we glue into it, and which, by filling the hole or the slot, present new singularities, which we can increase at will. These magnifying glasses are also available at all times in the indicated store. There are people who claim that they are the roots of boxwood, and others, of olive trees; but it's a mistake.

There is another species of Boxwood infinitely superior to this one, it is the one that comes to us from Spain; but, so as not to disturb the plan that we have drawn up, we will talk about it in the chapter on foreign woods.

THE MULBERRY, fig. 2, by its color, its veins, and its grain, resembles acacia; but it is a little less firm, although it has a certain stiffness which makes it quite difficult to cut at the Tour. Moreover, as this wood is rarely used in the arts, we only mention it here to make it known to people who would not have the opportunity to have it before their eyes.

THE APRICOT TREE, fig. 3, is known to everyone, but few people have the opportunity to know the interior of the trunk. It is quite pleasantly veined, if it turns passably; but it does not work well with a plane: as it is difficult to obtain a good healthy one, and it can only be used for masonry work, we will say nothing more about it.

The Yew, Fig. 4, is a wood which grows everywhere, but which is little cultivated today. It's a shame that this tree comes so slowly, and grows so little, because it is very pleasant. It planes quite well, provided it is used with suitable tools, because of the frequent knots. There is no one who does not prefer it for one of the most beautiful woods on the islands.

The yew burl fig. 5, presents a quantity of veins intertwined with each other, which, on a snuffbox, produce a very pleasant effect; but these magnifying glasses are spoiled by an infinity of defects which hardly allow one to find a somewhat beautiful box cover. It is up to the amateur to use his patience to split or have these burls or breeches split with care, to get the best possible use out of them. This wood is capable of the most beautiful polish.

THE ORANGE TREE, fig. 6. It is natural to allow ourselves to be biased in favor of objects which present to our eyes certain qualities which please us. There is no one, perhaps, who is not convinced that the wood of the orange or lemon tree must contribute to the good smell that its leaves and flowers exhale. We can judge that this wood presents nothing particular to the eye; 'it looks a little like charcoal, and its grain resembles that of hornbeam. It turns quite a bit, and also planes itself; but he feels absolutely nothing.

It is true that we are hardly able to obtain this wood in the state in which the others are, at least in the temperate or cold climates of France. Because, as the Orange Tree is there only for pure pleasure; that it is rare and quite expensive, we certainly do not dare cut down an Orange tree 8 to 10 feet high, expressly to find in its stem, a few boxes or other objects: also we will agree that the section that We obtained to define it and to engrave it, that it was dead wood, and that this circumstance can totally change its nature.

THE WHITE MULBERRY, fig. 7, presents one of those varieties of nature, which penetrate more and more with the deepest respect for the creator, and for his least works. It seems that there should only be a difference between the white mulberry tree and the black mulberry tree in the fruit, and that at most, the wood should be a little browned. However, if we compare the two woods together, we will hardly find any very marked resemblances. One resembles the elm by its veins, which are infinitely close together; the other only resembles it from a distance, by the way in which the veins are marked on the bottom of the wood: but the grain, the color, the texture, the compactness, are absolutely different. The white mulberry partially supports the tenons and mortises. Its fibers are intertwined, its pores tight and all coming to the surface. We can hardly appreciate the real merit of the Mulberry tree, which is not common enough in all parts of France to be able to use it for many works: but it seems to us that, in the southern provinces , it could be used very advantageously to build furniture, such as chairs, tables, and other parts of the art of the carpenter-furniture maker.

THE JUNIPER fig. 8, seems to be considered only by the slight odor it exhales. As this shrub is of little height and size, we can hardly take advantage of it for the arts. Its wood is quite soft, but it is very fine, capable of a beautiful polish, quite pleasantly veined, and we can say that it hardly deserves the attention of the amateur, only a few small <^ ijcts that we would like to make in French wood, precious or unique. Many are found in the Fountainbleau forest, where juniper is very common.

THE EVERGREEN OAK, or holm oak, fig. 9, so named, because in fact it has some connection with the oak, and because it is grown all year round, differs so much from the tree whose name it bears, that no one will ever be tempted to confuse them. Green bean, of a certain size, not being very common, we were only able to obtain it in the office of a natural history enthusiast: we did not have the opportunity to use it in the Round.

Its bark has no relation to that of the diene. It is very thick and very brown. The wood fibers are quite fine and tight; but wood, in itself, is not infinitely hard. In no way can we recognize the texture of ordinary oak. However, it has the color; but the spots with which it is dotted, and which are different, depending on whether it approaches being on its mesh, or whether it moves away from it, make it interesting. It seems to us, however, that this wood can only be used as a curiosity by the Turner, to make some vase, pedestal, or other inconsiderable part, which, presenting the wood in all its directions and all the fibers and veins cut , will offer a rather pleasant singularity: if one of our readers wanted to see several of them, of a certain size, on foot, they will find them in the Jardin des Plantes, behind the hothouses, where they provide shade, at point of view that was practiced there with great art and talent.

THE OLIVE TREE, fig. 9, PL 6, is a very useful tree, and the source of the wealth of some of our southern provinces. It grows abundantly in Provence, Languedoc, Italy, and also in Spain. Olive wood is very well veined and has a rather pleasant odor; it takes a very beautiful polish, which makes it sought after by cabinetmakers and tablet makers: as this wood is resinous, it is excellent for burning.

The terrible winter of 1709, which caused the death of a large number of olive trees, gave occasion to notice that this tree grows a number of roots, and that they persist in the ground for entire centuries. In 1709, more wood was obtained from these roots than from the stems and branches of the trees; several owners sold them for more money than their stock was worth.

We have not claimed to give the nomenclature and description of all the woods that grow in France. We have only focused on the main ones, and especially on those which can be taken advantage of in the arts, and particularly on the Tour. It is for this reason that we have neglected several, which are not very useful, such as chestnut, whose fibers are so smooth, the cootexture so weak, that no advantage can be taken from it, as wood , although it provides the most beautiful shade in our gardens.

*** SECTION III Des Bois étrangers.

We do not intend to give the names, properties, and uses of all the woods which come to us from the islands, and from several other parts of the world: we will only report the best known in the art of Touring and in the cabinetmaking, in order to enable our readers to know them at least by their main qualities, and to use them for the uses they deem appropriate. Mr. Hamelin-Bergeron keeps an assortment of these different species of wood.

SPANISH BOXWOOD, fig. 1, Pl 5, is the most common of all foreign woods. He far outweighs the one who believes in France. It is full, plain, of a beautiful yellow, quite often of thread and without knots; hard, binding; and although it turns much better than it planes, or nevertheless gets quite good use of it with the plane, provided that some precautions are taken. We make boxes of all kinds; and, as this bcHs had time to dry before being brought to us, it works very well shortly after we have used it. We get logs four feet long or about: we have them of all sizes, up to five and six inches, and sometimes more. It takes on a very beautiful polish. It is with this wood that we make flutes, oboes, clarinets, and some other wind instruments. This wood is one of the two that are best cut with the chisel, as soon as we have acquired a little usual to handle it. It appears, from a passage in Virgil, that the Ancients knew the art of turning, and that they knew how to use boxwood as it should be, since this poet says, Georgics, book 2, verse 449:

Nec tiliae leves, aut Torno rasile buxum
Non formam accipiunt, ferroque cavantur acuto.

The lime tree, however, yields to the iron which hollows it;
The boxwood, according to the Tour, takes on a happy shape.

Thus, not only did the Ancients turn the wood externally, but they even hollowed it out; and, in this quote, we see tilewood and boxwood, two woods opposed by their nature, taken as an example of what can be done on the Tour. Virgil describes, in the seventh book of the Aeneid, the clog game that children play, and says that they were played with boxwood:

Ceu quondam tarto volitans sub verbere turbo, 
Quem pueri magno in gyro vacua atria circum 
Intenti ludo exercent. Ille actus habend, 
Curvatis fertur spatiis : stupet inscia turba 
Impubesque manus, mirata volubile buxum.
Dant animas plagœ. 

AENEID. VII 378. 

Such under the folding whip which whistles and pursues him,
Roll this spinning boxwood that childhood enjoys;
He runs, he goes, an immense portico comes back to me,
The young troop observes with astonishment
Del cerdes that he describes the agile movement,
Practice it without respite, and, the animator ceases,
By redoubled blows, redoubles his speed.

The Ancients made wind instruments with Boxwood: but it appears that these instruments were limited to flutes which they coupled together to extract sounds, which, no doubt, were in tune, in any harmonic relationship, like the third. ; otherwise, it would have been an unbearable cacophony:

Ite per alta 
Dindyma, ubi assuetis biforem dat tibia cantum. 
Tympana vos buxutque vacant Berecyntia matris 
Idaeae
AENEID. IX. 617. 

Go on double sound of your Trojan flute,
Cymbals of brass, of a melodious boxwood,
Celebrate in your groves your mother of the Gods;
For his laughing Dindyme or green penny Berecynthe
Leave our painful camps, leave the enclosure.

This quote proves both the seniority of the Tour and the degree of perfection it was. Others take it much further, and find its origin in the art of clay pottering, which, as we know, is very ancient.

ROSEWOOD, fig. 2, among the island woods is the most common. This wood is hard, purple-brown, has fairly sensitive fibers, and some more or less obscure veins. It is surrounded by white sapwood, which is very soft and is of no use. Rosewood gives off a fairly pleasant odor, especially when, when working with it, you heat it, and give rise to a certain evaporation. It is very easy to turn and plan: we can make an infinite number of small pieces of furniture from it; but as it is very obscure, it has been banned from large pieces of furniture, since nothing is so sad: the cabinetmakers know how to brighten it up by cutting it with other woods, and not entering it until as a report document. It is more commonly used in veneer, that is to say, in strips of a good thickness, which are glued to masses of oak or fir. As this wood is susceptible to a beautiful polish, and is hard, although porous, it does not take glue well: therefore the joinery assemblies, made of Rosewood, would not be solid. Moreover, the mortises, if forced a little by the right tenons, could burst. This wood is excellent for making hose reels, as we will describe them, and especially cases. It comes to us here in logs 3 to 4 inches thick, 9 to 12 feet long, and 12 to 15 inches wide. It is sold by the pound like all foreign wood.

PURPLE WOOD, fig. 3, is so named because of its color; but what makes it very pleasant are the more or less light veins which highlight the background: this wood is very hard, works equally well with a plane and a lathe. It has all the qualities and disadvantages of rosewood, which we previously discussed. There was a time when all the furniture was veneered in purple wood; another species of wood was brought to Europe, and from that moment the first was relegated to the antechambers, or to less fortunate people, as always happens when fashion has decided. It is, however, certain that this wood is very pleasant for a Turner. We can make an infinite number of precious objects from it.

EBONY is of several kinds. It appears that the black one was the first brought to France, since, although there are green or green-brown ones, and others brown, we say proverbially, black like Ebony.

BLACK EBONY,fig. 4, which is usually called Ebony-Maurice, is commonly the most beautiful black, it is capable of a very beautiful polish. It is more usually used in veneer. It cannot be fitted with tenons or mortises. When we prepare it with an axe, we are quite surprised not to make any cracks, like all other wood, but to see the hatchings come off in fragments which break, and do not have any damage; with the rest, no adhesion. We cannot make the nature of these fragments more perceptible than by saying that it seems, when we chop black ebony, that we chop, not quite coal, but wood which would have been half-consumed in the fire, or perhaps in the water; which leads us to suspect that this wood loses part of its natural consistency, due to the time it spends after cutting it, and before bringing it to Europe. It is very prone to being split: so the merchants are careful to keep it in very convenient places. The pores of this wood are very tight; we see no veins in it, and we can barely distinguish the direction of its fibers. It turns perfectly. Joined to ivory, or to some white wood, such as holly, which is very fine, it produces a very beautiful effect; it is subject to being lashed with dirty white or gray spots which discolor it; the workers dye them black, and then polish them,

PORTUGESE EBONY, fig. 5, looks much more like wood than the black one: it is only a dark brown. We can clearly see the fibers and pores. Under the axe, the shavings rise like all other wood. It is very hard, and consequently takes on a very beautiful polish. This wood presents a particularity common to many others: we see there sapwood of a gray tending to brown, and which is hard enough and fine enough so that we can, in a few circumstances - tances, take advantage of it. It is called Portuguese Ebony, because it comes to us from the colonies belonging to the Portuguese, in the New World. It is much harder than black, which is only preferred because of its great blackness. .

GREEN EBONY, fig. 6, is so called, because in fact it is olive green. The nature of the wood is still much better characterized than in the two previous centuries. The veins are well marked by light shades which separate them. We also see a sapwood of an air-gray color, which appears to have a completely different nature than the bay itself; and who is good for nothing. Unless we are used to distinguishing wood, we are tempted to mistake green ebony for grenaidilla, to which it closely resembles, as we will be able to judge in a moment. Green ebony works wonderfully with a plane and a lathe. As long as one has acquired the practice of cutting wood well, all these island woods, having reached their hardness, come out almost polished after removing the chisel, especially for the small parts; we are only obliged to polish large ones, because of the inequality that the cuts of a chisel, the best used, can leave, and by the differences that the pores can cause. We can make excellent molding tools, for carpentry, with these two types of wood; as they contain a little gummy-resioeated substance, they slide more easily on the wood and are not easily damaged.

ROSEWOOD, or ROSEWOOD, fig. 7, is, without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable. The workers persist in calling it Bois de rose, although its name, which comes from its color, is Bois rose. It is moderately hard, very filamentous, the fibers are well linked to each other. It comes to Europe in logs, not in tables. He is prone to being rotten to the core. It was not more than 50 or 60 years ago that it was introduced to Europe, where its great beauty made it used for all kinds of veneer furniture. But, as it has the disadvantage of losing its color in the air in a relatively short time, it was soon abandoned. It is no longer used except by turners in small works, especially since mahogany, which we will talk about shortly, has taken its place. However, for several years, a very clear varnish has been applied to almost all the works made at the Tour which, by filling the pores, perfectly preserves the color without leaving any thickness. This method is a great preservative for all colored woods: it prevents contact with air from discoloring them, and gives them a shine that surpasses the most beautiful polish. We will give in the appendix the composition of this varnish.

This wood, when we saw it, plan it, or turn it, exudes an odor which is a little like that of roses. It is greasy under the tool, cuts well with scissors; but it spoils if you try to polish it with oil, and takes on a dull appearance. The safest thing is to polish it well with eao, and finish the polish dry. However, we still experience some difficulties in this regard, because the pink mud that comes out confuses all the veins in which it is incorporated, and gives it a false color, which only a little oil gives it. perfectly. To avoid either inconvenience, you can rub it with a slightly oily cloth.

We also make, with this wood, very pleasant little models. It supports the tenon well, but the mortises are prone to splitting, even if it is not assembled in Korea. It doesn't take the glue perfectly.

This wood is prone to having many large knots, of which great advantage is taken for veneer. To obtain more marked and more beautiful edges, it is split into strips at a slight angle; and all these nodes present nuances and sinuosities which are assembled in pairs or other symmetrical numbers, and which reassemble perfectly, being taken one on top of the other. Chi saw some decorative pieces in pink wood in Paris, which had the most beautiful effect.

GRENADILLA, fig. 8, is an excellent wood for turning. It is pleasantly veined with brown on an olive background. We see the sapwood, common to almost all woods. It is planed very well; and how very hard it is, the makers of instruments. mtttique make excellent flutes, which are preferred to those of ebony and boxwood.

Grenadilla can be used at the lathe, for a number of very pleasant works. It takes on the polish of an ice cream; and if it is not that its color makes it a little confused with acacia, which however does not resemble the grain, it would perhaps be more precious than it actually is.

LIGNUM VITAE, fig. 9, whose heart is brown and very hard, as we will say below, only resembles the sapwood of old wood when it is young. We only point out this particularity to confirm the general principle that young wood does not have all the characteristics which should distinguish it. We find, in this young wood, greenish nuances and accidents, which make it sought after. tablets to make different works. There are these woods which have no rusty color, up to at least four inches in diameter. It is only after a few years that the woods acquire their maturity and their perfection; and it is through the heart that this perfection is felt, because it is always through the circumference that the woods take their growth. This truth is particularly noted in the hazel, of which we spoke in the article from Bois de France. We quite often encounter, in the heart of the service tree, parts of an almost black brown, and of extreme hardness, although the body of the tree is almost white. 

BROWN LIGNUM VITAE, fig. 1, Pl. 6, is still an excellent wood, both for its fineness and for its hardness. The sapwood is distinguished by two very sensitive colors. Near the bark, this sapwood is yellowish white: further on, it darkens with dirty yellow, further obscured by an infinity of imperceptible black pores. Next comes the heart, which is olive-brown at first, and becomes lighter towards the center. This heart is weakly veined, and in a way that is particular to it. This wood is very hard, as good for the lathe as for the plane. They can be made into excellent grinding tools for carpentry. He himself. polishes perfectly, but with horsetail in water, because of the quantity of resin it contains. We receive it in quite large logs, so that we can find many pieces of a very large diameter. The variety of colors, which the sapwood and the heart present, Had a quite beautiful effect in the hollow or projecting parts.

In addition to the qualities that we have just spoken about, and which make him use excellent skills to Elect. casters for beds and other furniture, intaglio press cylinders, grinder's easels and pulleys for the navy, this wood is used in medicine, as a sudorific.

SERVICE TREE OF THE ISLANDS, fig. 2, closely resembles that of France, except for the corridor, which is much darker. This wood is very hard: it is good for making tools. It sharpens partially, and takes on a very beautiful polish. Its veins are more marked and more frequent than those of the European cormier. He has little harm; but, despite this, the heart, whose color approaches that of ebony, is always a little harder, and the pores are tighter than around the circumference. In general, Cormier des Iles is little used in France, and it would benefit from being known.

MAHOGANY is of two kinds: soft and hard. Tenderness is rather little esteemed. In Paris, they are made into common furniture, which people, who do not know anything about it, accept indiscriminately because of the name.

The English were the first to use this wood for furniture. The extent of their trade in America makes it so common in England that it is used as joinery wood in an infinite number of circumstances.

Mahogany has since become, in Europe, the most sought-after wood for

furniture, necessities, etc. , etc. We receive colonies in balls, that is to say, in large pieces, some of which are up to 3 feet square over a length of 15 to 20 feet. The cabinetmakers, who buy and buy, are very uncertain about the quality it will have, since they can only know it fully when it is split at the heart, and they cannot obtain this condition from their sellers.

Hard Mahogany is of two kinds: one veined, fig. 3, and the speckled, fig. 4. Mahogany, in general, is a reddish yellow when newly worked. It browns prodigiously in a short time, and finally becomes an almost black brown. The way to polish it, when it has been well worn, is to rub it with a pumice stone and oil, then to absorb all the oil by rubbing it with a piece of cloth and washed tripoli, until the tripoli remains very dry, and then varnish it, as we will indicate for all wood; this is the only way to delay its browning: a layer of lime water makes it purple, but this color is not long-lasting. In furniture, this wood, being quite hard, is very good, because it stains little, and keeps its polish well. But, used on apartment doors, as among the English, it spreads into the rooms a darkness which inspires sadness, and which French gallantry and elegance would have difficulty adopting, unless your fashion decided otherwise. . This wood is veined with brown, and even black. Sometimes the knots give it a changing and shimmering air, which has a very pleasant effect. It planes wonderfully; but as it is often knotty or wavy, he had to plan it with a small iron, or with a double iron planer: without this, you instantly think you are finishing a piece, you get quite deep chips. It turns quite well; but he must be very master of his chisel to cut the threads of the wood. The most beautiful is the one which, on a light background, offers dark veins; and nevertheless it is necessary to have a very great use, to know if it will subsequently become beautiful: because, when it is newly split or planed, it is difficult to judge what it will be.

Speckled Mahogany, fig. 4, is quite rare. It sells for much more than the other; but, used on cabinetmaking panels, it is of great beauty. It’s the louse that detaches your flies from the bottom; for, when it is fresh cut, these moudies only seem to be slight waves, and do not. to great effect. The only way in which we can recognize it is to see if, at the circumference, we notice any kind of wormholes.

There is a third species of hard Mahogany, of which we cannot give a figure: it is Mahogany caught in tree breeches, and which is in large trees what boxwood burls are in small: The workers call Brambles these pieces thus split, to a line or approximately, in thickness. We cannot describe the infinitely precious accidents that these rare pieces present; it is chance that provides them. We saw some which represented trees, which one would have thought painted with the greatest art. Others represent a countryside, a landscape; and, in this case, we split them in pairs, and we place them in opposition to each other, to repeat. the same image. But unless you buy these pieces from wood merchants, an amateur cannot hope to find them, unless it is used by chance, since, for furniture of the highest price, the workers are forced to feel an infinite number of planks.

Finally, there is another species of mahogany, which is called bastard mahogany, and which only resembles the real one in color. but it is very compact, very hard, and contains more resin. It is excellent to turn, the same color as that which is freshly cut; and it has the advantage of retaining its color and not blackening like all other species.

Mahogany is a species of American walnut. Its fruit, which is eaten lightly toasted, resembles halves or quarters of ordinary walnuts, and is very good.

THE GUADELOUPE WALNUT TREE, of which fig. 5 represents a portion, is a little-known wood. We do not know what its fruit is, but the wood has no resemblance in grain, color, or porosity to the common walnut. It is quite hard, turns and planes hard. GOOD. Its yellowish color, veined with more yellow, can have, in some circumstances, a fairly good effect.; but this is only a fancy piece of wood to vary a few pieces.

AMARANTH, fig. 6, owes its name to its color. It is quite hard, takes a nice polish, turns and planes very well; but its pores are not very tight: it produces a very beautiful effect when, in cabinetmaking, it is intelligently opposed to wood of a different color. We can say nothing about the way in which it grows, nor about its fruit: we only know it as being suitable for cabinetmaking and turning.

CEDAR, fig. 7, is a very well-known tree, by all that ancient authors have said about it, and by the properties given to it: the Cedars of Lebanon grew to a prodigious height: they made the framework of the Teraple of Solomon; but it seems to me that this is not the Cedar we have today. We see one in the Jardin des Plantes, which has already grown considerably, and yet it is possible that the difference in climate is detrimental to its growth. Cedar is quite similar to beech, except that it is much darker in color, and the pores are finer. It is soft, and for this reason alone it is not very suitable for construction, unless it has been used, as we use these long fir trees today, to make floors of a fairly large span, but which don't wear anything. Cedar has an aromatic smell, which distinguishes it from all your woods, even from two that have an odor. It is perhaps for this reason that it is attributed the property of being incorruptible, and of not being attacked by any insect. The smell of cedar is such that if one had any piece of furniture in an apartment, it would not be possible to stay there for long. Furthermore, it works wonderfully with a plane, and turns well, although very fragile; and if out of curiosity we wanted to select some piece of Tower, we could get to the end with great caution: but the main use of Cedar is to serve as an envelope for pencils.

CITRINE SANDALWOOD, fig. 8, closely resembles cedar. It is of an absolutely similar color, but its fibers are very different. It doesn't have more density. It gives off a very strong odor, but which cannot be confused with that of cedar. That of Sandalwood is intoxicating, and displeases until the end. This wood planes very well, and turns better than cedar. It is called Citrin, either to distinguish it from the Santal den which we are going to talk about, but because its smell is a bit like that of lemon. It is very fine, susceptible to a fairly fine polish, very soft to the touch, and its pores are very fine.

WHITE SANDALWOOD has no relation to the previous one. It is much more yellow than white. Its pores are quite fine, and tighter; and, if it resembles any wood, it is certainly the European chestnut, even in the bark, except that it is finer, harder, and is capable of real polishing, it works very well with a plane, and turns quite well. Furthermore, it is one of the woods that we use to vary objects, contrast colors with colors, and bring together, in the same place, all the varieties that nature offers in its productions.

THE SASSAFRAS, fig. 1, Pl. 7, seems to be more of a spongy substance than wood proper. Its pores are very loose, its fibers very coarse. It doesn't have a thread. Its bark is quite similar to that of the beech: it planes quite a bit, because it is very soft; but it is very difficult to turn, because of this very softness. It has a lightness which surprises at first, but which no longer surprises us as soon as we consider it, and we recognize in it the qualities by which we have just characterized it. This tree grows large and very branchy: it grows in Brazil, and in several other places in America. Its wood is used medicinally, as a sudorific and diuretic. It exudes a fairly strong odor, which makes it stand out from all the others.

Ordinary SATIN WOOD, fig. 2, is most pleasant, especially for cabinetmaking. Placed in opposition to other woods, it has the most pleasant effect. Apart from its color, and judging it only by its fibers, its pores, its density, we would take it for walnut which had been dyed, if it could be dyed in a light color. It is duck-yellow, and its pores, which seem like a pigeon's throat, give it a very pleasant change, depending on the light in which it is seen. It planes perfectly, and turns in absolutely the same way as walnut, to which , apart from the color, we can assure that it resembles everything.

YELLOW SATINWOOD, fig. 3, has no resemblance to the previous one. It is quite dark yellow, and veined in a few places. Its grain, its pores and its threads make it quite similar to white or Ruroit dyed saltwood, and on which natural veins would give, in some places, lighter or darker parts. We saw a boudoir in a library, where, under rather poorly observed rules of architecture, all the members had been fitted with wooden moldings of different colors: nothing was as beautiful, as imposing. t as rich. The parquet floor itself was a mosaic of different woods, used with taste and intelligence; and you saw, with pleasure, that all parts of the world had been called upon to decorate a reduced canopy. The columns were of yellow satin; the friezes of an opposite wood; red satin or coral denticles, etc. , etc. The cedar served as shelves; and the bases and other lower parts were of the finest mahogany.

Yellow Satinwood planes and turns perfectly. It comes to us in large enough logs, so that we can use it for whatever we want: but what is singular about it is that small worms, starting from the circumference, insinuate themselves until 'at the heart of the wood, and reveal pitting right up to the very front of the most beautiful pieces.

THE RED SATINWOOD, fig. 4. couldn't be more pleasant; but as its veins are very small, and the lines which form the satin are very fine, - it must be seen very closely or be used for small works. It is the most beautiful purple possible, veined with brown. He is very hard; takes a beautiful polish, works equally well with a plane or a Toiir; but once again, when we look at it from a little distance, it only looks like wood, which would be a very beautiful solid red; This wood is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful that the New World provides us.

THE COCONUT, fig. 5, is a wood which comes in all the lees of America. All naturalists agree that it seems that the Creator wanted, in this tree, to give travelers all the gifts at once. Its fruit is the size of a mediocre melon. The husk of this fruit is filamentous on the outside; but soon we discovered a very hard substance, capable of the finest polish. Internally this hull is very polished. When we open the fruit, a milky water comes out, very sweet, and which refreshes. The fruit is excellent to eat. The tree produces very nice shade. The species of hemp which surrounds it can be spun and form a fabric suitable for clothing.

Coconut wood contributes to the hardness of the fruit. It is very hard, very tight and very compact. It is not very veined: its fibers, although not very tight in appearance, are, in fact, very tight: we can judge this by the weight of the wood. It planes and turns perfectly; but, as its colors do not have much vibrancy, it seems to be only dyed wood. A table, made of Coconut, would have the very rare merit of not being able to be easily penetrated by colored liquors, which happens too often to the mahogany tables, which we use now.

MANCHINEEL, fig. 6, is a wood of a dark yellow and tending to brown. - 11 is veined and waves almost like maple, which it closely resembles; but it is much harder. It carries in the waves, some; clear which have a very pleasant effect. This wood is capable of a fairly nice polish. It planes very well, and turns just as easily. Nothing is as beautiful as a piece, made on the Lathe, with this wood: the veins and the waves are multiplied by the different cuts, which are highlighted by the bulges and the hollowed parts. If we take care to garnish these vases with ivory, as well as those made with almost all Indian woods, the veins, the waves, stand out more.

CORAL WOOD, fig. 7, is a wood which was given this name because of its superb coral color. It is indeed of the most beautiful age; but it has this singularity, that when it is cut or split, the part which is exposed to the air is yellow, and turns red in quite a few tenqis. This phenomenon can very well explain the influence of air on colors; and physics has already learned that a liquor steeped for a long time changes color; and this experiment was carried out on the spirit of wine of a thermometer, which, from red as it was, became barely slightly tinted. Chance would have broken the tube, and immediately the liquor regained its original color.

The coral is very fine, very hard, and therefore susceptible to a fine polish. It also works well with a lathe and a plane. But it can hardly serve, in either case, other than to highlight other parts, given that the uniformity of its color does not present anything very satisfactory to the eye.

Damask Coral, fig. 8, is much more valuable than the previous one. It is thus named, because in fact its veins are arranged in the same way as damask linen. It is a red (juice brown) and light in color, with the damask pleasantly highlighting its waves. Although less hard, very thin and more porous, it turns perfectly. It is also worked well with a plane: it is certainly one of the most pleasant planes in India; but it is quite rare. It has the most beautiful effect in the works of Tour, where the round parts, opposed to the hollow parts, multiply the waves and the damassores, and give birth to an infinity of accidents of the greatest beauty.

PARTRIDGE WOOD, fig. 9, is yet another species of very hard wood, which can be confused at first glance with rosewood, but which is much lighter, more compact, and consequently heavier. In addition to the perpendicular fibers, there are transverse ones, which one would believe drawn with a ruler, so regular are they. The opposition of these fires produces, on a piece made at the Tour, very piquant and

the most pleasant. It planes perfectly, turns in the same way, and takes on a beautiful polish: it has no very marked veins; but we see there an infinity of small gray-brown flies, which have given it the name of Wood, of Partridge. Its fibers are similar to those of rosewood. The entailtists cut it obliquely to its grain and with great skill, as well as almost all the woods of which we have spoken, to further highlight their veins, and the accidents which are encountered there.

VEINED JASMINE, fig. 1, Pl. 8, is infinitely hard, dark brown, veined with small flames. All these woods have their sapwood more or less sensitive, more or less beautiful, depending on whether it approaches its state of perfection; This is what we can notice in this one. It cuts perfectly, and is also suitable for the lathe and the plane. They make excellent rules and other mathematical instruments. None of the woods of the islands can be characterized by their bark, seeing that as the freight to the sea ports, and the transport, by water, from the port to the capital, are very expensive, it is useless to bring, to Europe, a part which should not and cannot be used for anything, and which he would have to throw away when he arrived.

SPECKLED JASMINE, fig. 2, is roughly similar to the previous one, except that the speckles are more decided. It is just as hard and as thin as the previous one. You can hardly see the pores. The sapwood is arranged in the same way. It polishes perfectly, turns and planes equally well. We make violin ardiets of both; and, by its singularity, and by its beauty, we can create an infinity of very pleasant objects and thus diversify a work in which we wish to vary the woods to infinity, to enhance each other.

SNAKEWOOD, fig. 3, is a third species of wood from China
It is very fine, very compact and very hard. H couldn't be more pleasant in cabinetmaking, where it produces the most decided effect. It planes and turns well. Its veins are thrown in different directions, and present very interesting plays of nature, depending on whether it is used or cut. The different shades that it offers to the eyes, from pink to very dark red-brown, arranged with art, can stand out from other woods that it frames, or with which it is placed in opposition. It is the same for the works of Tour. We can make vases or other turned pieces from them, and garnish them with wood opposite in color, or in ivory; arrange the cuts so that the veins repeat symmetrically; in a word, it is one of the most precious woods that come to us from China.

SPANISH ELM, fig. 4, resembles, in many respects, somewhat pale boxwood. It planes and turns perfectly. It is very strong, very tight and very hard. Its bark resembles that of the small elm, a wood from France. But what distinguishes this wood from all others is that it gives off a very pleasant and very sweet odor. It is claimed that a little of this wood, scraped and put in a snuffbox, gives the tobacco the pleasant taste of macoubac.

IRONWOOD, fig. 5, so named because of its great hardness, is quite similar in color to rosewood wood, and in the way it is veined, to purple wood. It contains a very large white sapwood, which contributes to its great hardness. It is such that the natives of the Antilles used it, before the discovery of America, to make sabers, the wounds of which were very dangerous and often fatal. Although this wood is perfectly good for working with a plane and a lathe, it presents too few varieties for anything very curious to be done with it on the lathe; and we can say that he only has the merit of hardness, a merit that he possesses to a supreme degree. Also, the enthusiasts make rulers, squares, and carpentry tools from them, which are highly sought after, despite their cost. A guillaume, for example, who, to be good, needs to maintain his straightness, not to cut on any crooked wood, and to cut very finely, especially when we want to cut sharp corners. , is perfectly good in Ironwood.

BRAZIL WOOD, fig. 6, is a very dark red and tending to brown. It presents nothing spicy for the cabinetmaker, or for the turner. It is hard, tight, has fine pores> cuts and planes very well.; but it has qualities and properties that make it sought after above all others: it is with this wood that we make red dyes, more or less dark, depending on whether we add teb or such ingredients. , as we will say in a separate chapter. We cut it into small shavings, and we boil it in water: and so that the division of the coloring parts happens even better and faster, we grate it into curly and very small shavings; at least, that's how it is sold ^ in Paris, among certain grocers-druggists, in small numbers, who keep it.

LOGWOOD, fig. 7, is still a wood that receives little attention in the art of Turning, and in cabinetmaking. Its color is a fiery red; but its knots, worked and polished, create quite a beautiful effect. It looks quite similar, in color, to. mahogany which has not yet blackened. But this wood is used a lot to dye a beautiful red, as we will see in the chapter on wood dyeing. The stiffness with which it becomes bright red when thrown into boiling water, impregnated with a little alum, is surprising.

BRAZILWOODC, or, as the experts say, femambourg, fig. 8, is still a red stained wood. Being worked with a plane, or on the lathe, it perfectly resembles soft, slightly veined mahogany. It does not blacken in the air; it has fairly fine pores, takes polish well: but, as it is only used for dyeing, we will not say more.

We will end this article of the woods, with an object of pure curiosity, and which chance has placed in our hands: it is a small planchette, taken from a bush of a tree which we call Palm tree; we see two in the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris.

fig. 9, represents this species of wood, if we can say that it is one. It seems rather, considering it by its bark, and by its transverse section, that it is only a meeting of small filaments, adhering to the BUS aqx others, by means of a gray substance, which is of a completely different nature. nature, and which seems purely medulpheire. It planes quite well; but we didn't have the opportunity to shoot any. Considering it from its end, it resembles an infinity of rushes which are pressed against each other, and whose intervals are filled with wax of mediocre whiteness. We do not know what this wood could be used for, which we have only spoken of here because of its rarity and singularity.

** CHAPTER II Du Laboratoire.
*** SECTION I Composition d'un Laboratoire.
In all the arts, it is necessary for those who practice them to know the tools and utensils. 'Often, and we have experienced this for ourselves, for lack of knowing all the tools, we take a lot of trouble, and we waste a lot of time to do what with a clean tool we would have done in a moment. This reason seemed decisive to us in giving, in the course of this work, the figure of the most common tools, and the explanation of the uses to which they are used. A second reason still deterred us from describing them: it is to provide amateurs, far from the capital, with the ease of obtaining them without error, as often happens, for lack of sufficient designation, by simply indicating the board and the number of the one or those they want. We will only give here the list of the main tools which are part of the composition of a laboratory.

This number of tools will seem considerable to those who only deal particularly with the Tour; but as carpentry, forging, and fitting are linked to it, and are almost inseparable from it, each person will choose what is necessary for the work he wants to undertake.

As for your way of arranging them in a laboratory, it is difficult to designate their location, which must, in all cases, be subject to locality; However, it is the rule to place the Lathe in the air closest to the windows, and so that the daylight arrives to the right of the Turner. The spiked lathe, the carpenter's workbench, the vices must receive the light opposite; The portrait lathe, as well as the guilloche one, must be arranged to receive the daylight on the left. Gouges, chisels and other tools will be arranged, in order, in racks along the walls.

We cannot blame a laboratory where all the parts and tools are artfully arranged, in glass-enclosed cabinets, where we see several Lathes mounted according to their nature: here a Lathe in the air; further on an oval lathe, there a guilloche lathe, elsewhere a portrait lathe, etc.: tools fitted with luxury, very careful carpentry workbenches, well-polished vices and perfect dies.

This assemblage presents a pleasant and methodical look: and it is very suitable for opulence to thus preserve the productions of genius, and the useful inventions of artists. We cannot hide the fact that the work produces a lot of dust, and that we need these precautions if we want to preserve the most precious parts of a laboratory. Whatever object we are turning or planing, after a few moments we are surrounded by shavings which jump from all sides: these shavings produce, despite the greatest care, a subtle dust which sticks everywhere .

When you want to have a very clean laboratory, you must have in another room a simple Lathe, the nose of the shaft of which is similar to those of the various Lathes which make up the laboratory. We rough out the piece to be turned, and we carry it to finish on the precious lathes.

** CHAPTER III De la Menuiserie.
*** SECTION I Manière de Débiter les Bois et Outil employés à cet usage.
Carpentry being closely linked with the art of the Turner, it seems essential to us to give some notion of it: they are limited to the description and use of the tools specific to this art, the use of which will frequently be indicated in the various works that we will be taught to perform. We therefore undertake to only develop this art in ways that can be adapted to the various needs that a Turner experiences.

The first of all is to cut down your wood.

Cutting wood is the action of sawing it, into logs (I), into tables, boards or frames.

For the first operation, we use the saw, fig. 1, Pl 9, named Passe-partout. This type of saw being intended for sawing green wood, its teeth must be long and separated by an equal space at their base. Without this precaution, the sawdust clumps between the teeth, preventing the saw from flowing, and the force from going sideways, despite the will and skill of the person operating it.

This type of saw is sharpened with a triangular bastard line, about 8 inches long, by tilting it from left to right and from right to left, following the teeth in pairs, like a, b, fig. . 1.

Then, after turning the saw over, we make those c, d, fig. 1, which had been left. This type of saw needs a lot of track. We give the way to a saw, by tilting as evenly as possible, and from one end to the other, alternately one tooth on the right and the other on the left.

(I) Portipn of tree covered with its bark. (TODO put this at the end of the page)

This operation is done by means of an instrument, fig. 50 and 50 bis Pl. 9, named Tourne-à-gauche.

Before proceeding with the description of the other saws, we will give that of a press, intended to sharpen them, and we will indicate the precautions to take to do it well.

For this purpose, we imagined a press, fig. 23, Pl 9, in which a notch A is made; we place the blade of the saw in this notch, and we fix it securely, by means of the screws B B. This press can be placed in several ways, either on the carpenter's workbench, by means of the jack, or on the Lathe workbench, with the support bolt, which is passed through the groove C

The press and the saw being thus arranged, the necessary path is given to the saw; then we pass over the top of the teeth, and perpendicular to the blade, a soft, flat file, and as large as possible, to even out the teeth. This precaution is of the greatest necessity, because two disadvantages would result from the inequality of the teeth. The longest teeth would be the only ones that would cut, and, wearing out more than the others, would soon become dull. and would prevent the saw from cutting, and, for the same reason, they would prevent the saw from cutting.

This observation is applicable to all saws, which only differ from each other by the greater or lesser size of the teeth.

The blade thus fixed, we present the file transversely to the blade, and inclined following the teeth of the saw: we begin by deepening the diminutive teeth by the first operation; then makes the teeth sharp by filing them, with the greatest care, from one edge to the other. It is not unnecessary to say that the blade must flow into the press as the length which was gripped there has been filed down.

The wood is cut into boards, tables and frames.

The board is a portion of tree split in its length and width, having 6 to 8 lines of thickness.

The table is a portion of split tree as above, 3 to 5 inches thick.

The frame is caliber wood, usually measuring 6 inches wide by 3 inches thick.

Although all wood can be prepared in this way, only beech and oak wood are commercially known under these names.
To cut the wood in this way, we use the saw, fig.2, Pl.9, called Slitting saw. It is made up of two uprights assembled by two crosspieces, on which flow two boxes which receive the blade. One of these boxes carries a screw, used to tighten the blade. This construction allowing it to be brought closer to one or the other of the mountains as much as the need requires, it will be easy to separate such strip parallel to one of the banks as is deemed suitable. The teeth of this type of saw are an isosceles triangle, and are sharpened with a three-quarter file, 6 inches long.

The saw, fig. 3, PI. 9, called German saw, often replaces the resaw among cabinetmakers. The property of the blade to rotate in all directions allows the mount to be placed in a position such that the part being sawn is never in contact with the mount. This type of saw has the advantage, over the slitting saw, of detaching a very thin part from one of the edges of a table, of cutting curved parts having a large radius; finally, to saw any board or table transversely, placing the width of its blade parallel to the arms.

The blade of this saw only differs from that for splitting by the teeth which are finer, and to which less track is given, being intended for cutting more precious wood. The blade is attached to two AA jaws, the tails of which BB pass through the CC arms; the DD handles are used to move the blade. To carry out this operation, we will turn the handles one after the other, after having relaxed the rope one turn, a precaution which must be taken for all saws assembled according to the principle of this one. We will observe that the temperature acting powerfully on the strings, it will be good to relax them every time we have finished working: otherwise, the mounts become awkward, or even break at the point where we expect it. the least.

The saw, fig. 4, is called Scroll Saw. It only differs from the previous one by the size of the frame which is smaller, and by the blade which is narrower. The deurture and the way are almost the same. This type of saw is specially designed to follow all the contours of the pieces that we wish to cut; it saves a lot of wood in that it allows you to follow all the lines that can be traced, and requires no other thickness between each piece than its passage. We invite the reader to remember that for this saw, as with all rotating saws, the greatest attention must be paid to clamping the two ends of the blade when changing its position: otherwise, being left in its length, it would be difficult to direct it.
Fig. 5 represents the tenon saw. Its blade is 26 to 28 inches long, and 26 to 28 lines wide. Its teeth are average, not very inclined, and it has little track. Its blade is fixed to the arms e e, by a notch parallel to its length. Often, to fix it there, a slightly riveted pin is used. This method has the disadvantage of splitting the arms. These pins are replaced, for greater strength and cleanliness, by copper or iron A A jaws, in which the blade is gripped and stopped by means of two pins. The blade, thus adjusted, is placed in the notches made in the arms and heads d d; jaws forming the cap exert force on the arms of the saw, which will be held stronger, due to the triple thickness which must receive the notch. This adjustment makes it easier to disassemble the saw.

The saw, fig. 6, which we are going to describe, is called a leveling saw; it deserves the attention of the amateur, because of the perfection demanded by its mount and its blade. This instrument being intended to follow very closely the line of an assembly, the blade must be very even, very equal in thickness, have 16 to 20 inches in length, and 16 to 20 lines in width. The teeth must be fine, very even, slightly inclined, and have almost no tracks. It is assembled like the tenon saw. Iron or copper jaws are especially applied with advantage to this species of saw; they hold and prevent the blade, which is very thin, from wobbling. This type of saw must be sharpened with the greatest care; This care depends on the purity of the blends, which must not be rejected by Guillaume.

The saw, fig. 7, is called Hand Saw. The shape of its blade gives it properties that are particular to it; it can be inserted into difficult places, where mounted saws cannot pass. It is very useful in a laboratory, either for detaching objects mounted on the tower, or for sawing pieces held in the vice. Its small volume and the shape of its frame make it familiar to the amateur.

There are saws of this type whose blade is undermined, tempered very hard, and the teeth are very fine. They are held at their top by a copper or iron back, which makes them called back saws; they are very good for precious woods, and even for metals.

There are still saws mounted in the same way, whose blades are very narrow and pointed, which makes them called Passe-partout, fig.8: we can with these saws, using a hole , practice, an opening in a panel.

Fig. 9 is a saw, toothed on both sides, the handle of which is bent, and has no other use than to trim off the excess of the dowels put in place.

We will end this article with some observations on the best means to use for sawing straight; because there are few amateurs who are not embarrassed to follow a line exactly with a saw or to cut straight.

The first cause is the lack of care taken in sharpening saws.

The second is to want to cut soft and green woods, with blades whose teeth are fine and have little tread, and the opposite for hard woods.

The third is the impatience of the person operating, who, believing he is going faster, presses too much on the saw: which causes the blade to veil and carries it in spite of himself to the right or left.

It is therefore necessary, to saw well, to choose the saw suitable for the material you intend to cut, and for the work you want to do; present it perpendicularly and parallel to the line you want to follow; erase his body so that the movement that the arms make does not bother him. However, we must not stray too far: this would make the position tiring, and would cause us to lose sight of the line we must follow. If in this position the saw is pushed straight and without swinging it, the operation will necessarily be good. You should also take care to grease the blade from time to time with bacon or tallow.

*** SECTION II Manière de Préparer les Bois au rabot.

After having cut the wood, the Turner feels the need to refinish it, if he intends it for parts subject to assembly, or to prepare it if his intention is to work it on the Turn. We will therefore describe the instruments used for these preparations.

To prepare the wood, the essential part in a laboratory is, without doubt, the German-style carpenter's workbench. Fig. 10 represented one bringing together all the advantages that one could desire. It differs from ordinary workbenches by a second press, along its length, with which all the pieces can be gripped by their ends, whatever their length.

Box A is fixed to the workbench by a slide. Screw B, by means of a crank, moves this box forwards and backwards, which has its upper side pierced with a square hole into which hook c enters. At the other end between a comb and spring hook D, which, as in the other workbenches, rises and falls at will; on the same line are made six square holes suitable for receiving a second hook similar to that c. It is placed in one of these holes, according to the length of the part that we wish to grasp, which is solidly fixed by the pressure of the return screw B. This ingenious means gives the advantage of being able to operate on three sides of the seized part. Space E is used to grip a piece perpendicularly. Cabinetmakers use it to saw veneer sheets, straight and miter tenons, and finally to press small pieces after gluing. The parallel press F is too well known for us to describe its various uses; we will suffice to say that it is particularly intended to remove long and wide pieces, to prepare the edges, and to groove them in the event of assembly. The movable foot G is used to support, by means of a dowel, the length of the parts gripped in the press. This leg runs between the two legs at the front of the workbench, and is pierced, on its height, with all squares to receive the dowel or chinlet mentioned above. The surface of the workbench is pierced with several round holes, to receive the jack, fig. 11.

The double jack, fig. 12, the stem of which is round and movable, approximately 18 inches long, and tapped at its half with a double pitch to receive the nuts of the shape of that To which are fixed to the underside of the workbench, by means of two strong wood screws, has the advantage of tightening two pieces flat at the same time with much more force and ease than it is possible to do with the ordinary jack; because we use the crank as a lever: this means provides the advantage of not disturbing the piece, a fairly ordinary disadvantage of the simple jack which we are obliged to tighten with blows of a mallet We experience no difficulty in gripping with this instrument a piece of whatever shape it may be, because of the ease which one has of placing it on three points of the workbench; if it happened that only one side of this jack was useful, we would use a stepped corner, fig. 13, to hold the unused side. For this purpose we would use the notch the plvs in relation to the thickness of the piece that we would have to grip; This tool, which couldn't be more useful, can replace the horizontal parallel vice.

It is useless to describe the ordinary sergeant. This tool is too imperfect and too well known. The one, fig. 14, brings together many more advantages than the first.

The property of the screw, of tightening with force and without shaking, is known to everyone. It is used in the type of sergeant that we are going to describe.

It consists of a flat stem, 18 lines of ugliness, 4 or 5 thick, and of an indeterminate length. This rod is curved at its upper part, and carries at the end of its curvature a bulge or eye A, in which the screw B moves. Along the length of this rod are made teeth or racks, intended to receive the hook mobile C. We attach it to the tooth which suits the part, which we want to tighten: it is then gripped between points D, C.

Cabinetmakers replace this instrument with the one fig. 15, made entirely of wood, therefore less solid and less tight. It follows from these two defects that we need three or four sergens of this type to tighten a joint, which would be sufficiently held with one, or two at most, made of iron.

Fig. 16 is an iron hand press named Happe. This instrument, which is used almost continuously, is used for veneering flat, curved partials, and for gluing all kinds of small parts. We must have at least a dozen, in pairs, and of various sizes. The drawing is sufficient to make the construction known, we dispense with describing it.

This instrument can also be replaced by the one in fig. 17, built of wood. It has the same disadvantages that we indicated when talking about wooden sergeants.

*** SECTION III Manière de Contrer les Bois et Outils nécessaires.

We call woodworking the action of straightening surfaces and putting them square in relation to each other, or, in curved or inclined parts, of determining the curvature or inclination of a face in relation to another one. We will not dwell on this last operation which essentially belongs to carpentry, and which would be of little use to the Turner.

When you have chosen your wood of a caliber proportionate to the work you are undertaking, you will give on the most beautiful surface, that is to say which presents the fewest defects, a plank of varlope to be roughed. , called by the Riflard carpenters. This tool is nothing other than a jack, shorter than the others, whose iron is sharpened a little short and round in relation to its cutting edge. The light is more open than in the varlopes, because the first asperities that are detached from the surface of the wood form very uneven shavings, in thickness which would quickly obstruct an ordinary light.

After this preliminary operation, we take the varlope fig. 18, to complete planing and erecting this first surface. This tool, the underside of which must be very straight, has its iron inclined at approximately forty-five degrees, sharpened very sharply and almost squarely; the opening is very narrow: without it, the chip could slip between the tool and the workpiece.

If you want to straighten perfectly, it is essential to set it well, that is to say to place the iron so that it takes little wood, and that the edge is parallel to the surface. lower part of the jack. Despite these precautions, it often happens that the piece we are working on is actually straightened along its length, but by applying a ruler placed diagonally, we see that its surface is convex from one angle to the other, and concave at opposite angles: what workers call Left Surface. When you are used to it, you can see this beginning at a glance by placing the surface parallel to your eyes and tilting it so that the first edge erases the second: this is what the workers call bornoyer. But another safer way is to have two slightly long rulers which will be placed transversely on each end of the piece: then by limiting, as we have just said, the slightest defect becomes sensitive to the eye, being multiplied by the length of the rules. This is why the longest ones are the best for this use.

This last method is used successfully when you want to dress copper or iron pieces, with a file or a jack, if you have one suitable for this use. We believe that it is not out of place to say something here about the shape and quality of these jacks.

The best ones are made of iron. The light is perpendicular; the iron, made of molten steel, is very thick, and pushed to the cut by a return screw which prevents it from moving back. It is also made of cast iron with a hollow part in the middle to facilitate the adjustment of the iron. For economy, those who rarely use these tools garnish wooden jacks with a well-dressed iron sole for this use; but the iron must always be placed upright.

Let us return to the understanding that this digression made us lose sight of for a moment. The first surface, having to serve as a basis for all subsequent operations, we cannot take too much care to set it up exactly and in such a way that a good rule, placed on all the directions, will barely allow the light to pass through.

We agree that this operation, however simple it may seem, presents great difficulties, especially to people unaccustomed to pushing the jack. It often happens that they only obtain, with a perfectly straight plank, a convex surface along its length, called Bouge by the workers. This defect comes from the fact that the wood is easier to start at the beginning, and that the right hand which holds the handle of the jack weighs on the part which is outside the piece. Likewise, when you push the jack to the other end, it is the left hand which, pressing the button, imperceptibly lowers the tool. These effects, although not very significant. themselves, become sensitive when they are multiplied by the number of times that the varlope passes through the piece: To avoid this inconvenience, it is necessary, at the beginning, to press with the hand, left alone, and only use the right push the jack. Likewise, when you reach the other end, you must stop pressing with the left hand, and finish with the right alone. After having established these principles which apply to planes of all kinds, we will abandon the amateur to habit who is undoubtedly the best master. The first surface being completed, it is necessary to erect the second and place it squarely in relation to the first, using a good wooden or iron square, fig. 21, which is presented at all points along the length of your piece; then, with a gauge, fig. 19, set to the width that the piece must have, we will draw two lines parallel to one of the surfaces drawn up above and below. Then we remove with a jack all the wood that exceeds these lines. If the piece is square, we will repeat this operation on the remaining face, and if we have operated correctly, the square must be applied to the last two faces as on the first two.

It often happens that the second face should not be perpendicular to the first. In this case, the degree of inclination is determined using a movable square called by carpenters, Sauterelle or false square fig. 20. This instrument will serve as the fixed square to plan this second face in relation to the first.
We believe it is useless to say more about an art which is only accessory to that which we deal with in this work; and we will limit ourselves to indicating the form and use of the various tools that an amateur must have in his laboratory.

Fig. 22 is a miter joint: it is an elongated plane which holds the middle between the joint and the plane. This tool is used to corral, to straighten and to re-level small works, as well as to dress the miters; what the workers call failing. You must have three: the first, for hard woods and brambles, must be with a standing iron, that is to say have the light perpendicular and the iron sharpened a little short. Some workers tilt the light in relation to the length of the tool. This method seems to us to have some advantages. The second must have the iron inclined at forty-five degrees; and the third must be double iron. The advantage of the latter is that it never silences any outbursts.

Fig. 24 represents this double iron developed and assembled. A, is the iron which cuts, seen flat, its bevel below. B, is a long square stud, drilled in the center and tapped to receive the screw C, which connects the second iron D, with the previous one. This iron is a little curved at the end, as seen on the A-shaped profile, makes the clamp, and rests as close as possible to the cutting edge. By this means, the chip, produced by the cutting iron, is forced to change direction, and is broken at its base by the iron above: the greatest care must be taken to sharpen this iron, and take little wood .

This last precaution must also apply to all carpenter's tools; often an amateur thinks he is advancing his work by applying a lot of iron, but in a short time his light becomes clogged: he is obliged to remove the shavings using an iron point; by this he destroys his light, chips the iron, and loses a lot of time.

The plane, fig.25, has the same shape as the miter plane, but it is much shorter; we leak from 4 to 8 inches. You need to have several for the reasons that we detailed in the jacking article. It is especially essential to have one, in which a fluted iron is placed along its length, and which is called a tooth plane. This plane is essential for preparing burl parts and sheets of precious wood, intended for veneer; as also to form small roughnesses, serving to retain the glue on all the surfaces that we want to join.

Figs. 26 and 27 represent two curved planes, one concave and the other convex. We see by their shapes that they are intended to re-flatten the curved parts: their curvature varies depending on the shape of the parts, and they are almost always tools for the occasion.

Fig. 28 represents a plane, called Mouchetté, intended to round the different molding bodies. There are few that vary so much in width and shape. It is done from 1 line to 18, and on different portions of the circle.

Fig. 29 represents the round plane: it is the counterpart of the previous one, that is to say that it did in hollow what the other does in relief, and varies in the same way.

Fig. 30 represents a guillaume: this tool differs from other planes in that the light occupies its entire thickness, and that the iron exceeds a little on the sides: which allows it to cut at a sharp angle and to dig a rebate of its thickness. They range from 6 lines to 15 in thickness, and 9 to 15 inches in length. There are certain cases where it is necessary to have one with a standing iron, fig. 3o bis.

Fig. 31 represents a tool named Feuilleret; it differs from the previous one in that to the left of the worker it has a cheek which serves as a support against the bank where we want to lift a rebate. The rest of the tool looks exactly like the guillaume.

Figs. 32 and 33 indicate the shape given to all molding tools. It is always necessary to proportion the molding to the thickness of the wood, as well as to the distance from which it must be seen; because a certain form which, up close, has a pleasant effect, is no longer the same at a certain distance. The reason is that the eye easily grasps the delicate profiles placed close to it, whereas when they are far away, it only sees the masses. All molding tools carry, like the leaf, a cheek which serves as a guide. It would take too long to talk about each of these moldings in particular. It is up to the artist to determine which one suits them. We will simply add that if he experiences any difficulty in preparing them himself, he will always find complete assortments at the indicated store.

Fig. 34 represents a universal bouvet, commonly named by
the Bouvet workers of two rooms.
The first part carries the iron, which is very thick, on its edge, and varies from one line to four. A copper cheek is adapted to this part, which rises and falls by means of two return screws. This cheek is used to determine the depth of the groove that we propose to make. The other part of the bouvet is a cheek which moves away from the previous one, using two threaded wooden rods, and four nuts which fix it at the determined distance. Fig. 34 bis represents the bouvet, seen by you.

There is another bouvet, nonunate Bouvet assembly, fig. 35. This tool is composed of two parts separated or joined at the will of the person who uses it. One has the forked iron, and is used to make the tongue; the other carries a simple iron to dig the groove. The thickness of the boards you want to assemble determines the size of the bouvet. To assemble two tongue-and-groove boards, it is necessary to start by giving the flat a stroke on the most beautiful side, which should serve as a guide for the plank, then perfectly straighten the fields or banks to then level them, at the same time. using the bouvet, one the tongue, the other the groove. If you have more than two boards to join together, all of them, except the first and last, must have a tongue on one side and a groove on the other. When the groove is made, it is necessary to refresh the fields with a jack which cuts well, and which takes little wood; then, with a guillaume, remove the interior angles of the groove. To make the tongue, when the bank is well erect, it is also necessary to knock down the two angles with the jack, so that the bouvet takes hold more easily. When the tongue is made, we give a blow with a guillaume on the visible joint;; then we remove the corners from the top of the tongue.

The height of the tongues and the depth of the grooves are 3 to 5 lines, depending on the thickness of the wood. When you find yourself limited by the size of the wood, or when you use precious wood, you make a groove on each edge, and you bring in a stick of good wood, which fills the two grooves, without however touching the bottom. We cannot conceal that the latter means is the best; but, as it requires more time, it is only used in the two cases indicated above.

Fig. 19 represents the gauge. This tool is made up of two main parts: part A is the plate pierced in its center with a square hole, or any shape, into which a rod B of a similar shape enters with just friction. A flat mortise is drilled on the thickness of the plate A to receive a wedge which crosses it, and serves to fix the rod B at the determined point. At one end of this rod are small steel points. On an ice sheet we put only one, and on the other faces, two spaced apart from each other by the thickness of the most common donkey's lips.

On some jigs we put, instead of points, a blade fixed in a mortise by a small corner. This blade acts as a cutter, and is used to remove moldings as well as to cut fillets of veneer wood. The shape and size of this tool vary according to the taste of the person using it.

Fig. 36 represents the miter square: its shape and name sufficiently indicate its use; we cannot take too much care in the choice of this tool, because if it is wrong, it can lead to major errors being made.

Fig. 21 is the square called by the workers triangle. It must be, like your previous one, perfectly correct. The best way to ensure this is to fix a good ruler flat on a well-prepared board: draw a perpendicular to this ruler with the square; then, having turned the square, we draw another line as close as possible to the first. If the two lines are exactly parallel, the square is correct: otherwise, the lack of parallelism indicates the side where there is too much wood. We thought we would please our readers by teaching them this way of justifying the squares, which are subject to becoming disturbed as they age.

Fig. 20 is a mobile square, named by the workers Sauterelle, or false Square. Its use is to preserve the opening of a corner, and to relate it to all the pieces which must follow, and whose line is irregular. It is essential that the hinge is correct, and cannot vary when the instrument is transported.

Fig. 37 is the ordinary crankshaft. This tool is so well known that we do not feel it necessary to give a description of it.

Fig. 38 represents the coulter or splitting knife, the blade of which is 8 to 10 inches long and 1 inch wide; the back is 8 or 10 lines thick; its two faces form a sharp corner A. At one of the ends is a round eye, or socket, flared on the side of the cutting edge, to facilitate entry of the handle, and retain it in its place. The handle, sheared, and about a foot long, is perpendicular to the blade. This tool, intended for splitting wood, is sometimes replaced by the hatchet. But the latter, whose edge is curved, often engages in the middle of the piece that is being split: which causes the sides to burst, Moreover, by striking with the mallet on the eye of the ax , we destroy it in a short time.

Fig. 39 represents an ax intended for roughing ivory, horn and hardwoods. It has a reinforced body, a short bevel, although very sharp, making it more curved than that of ordinary minced meat. The board is straight, and the handle in line with the edge. This ax must be tempered harder than those used for working wood.

Fig. 40 is another axe, named Turner's Axe. The steel, as in the previous one, is welded into a board; the blade is wider, thinner, less curved, and its edge is sharper. The socket, which receives the handle, is oblique to the cutting edge, so that, if it was used to rough out a surface of a certain width, the hand would not run any risk.

Fig. 41 represents the clasp. It is a chisel whose steel is between two irons, and therefore sharpened to two bevels, which gives it a lot of strength. The carpenters use it to close large works: those they use range from 1 inch to 3. There are other clasps, for the use of sculptors; they are shorter and thinner, and carry from 2 to 18 lines

Fig. 42 represents a chisel whose steel is on one side, and which is sharpened to a bevel, which distinguishes it from the previous one, which, moreover, is thicker. Carpenters use it to align mortises and tenons, as well as to finish parts that cannot be finished with a plane. This tool needs to be sharpened very fine; there are from 3 lines up to 2 inches.

Fig. 43 offers a curved chisel, called Gouge, whose use is to form curved parts, to push grooves. We. find them of all curvatures and of all widths.

Fig. 44 represents the bec-d'ane: it is a chisel intended for making mortises; its leader carries from one line to six.

The bent barley grain, fig. 45, is used to push triangular grooves: we are often obliged to bend gouges and chisels in this way, in order to be able to direct our tool along the length of a piece we see; flute without risking injury to your fingers.

Figs. 46, 47, 48 and 49 represent tools called Ecouanes or Grelettes of various shapes: we will not dwell on their use which we will often have occasion to talk about in the course of this work.

Fig. 51 is a plane or knife with two handles, very convenient for preparing the wood that we want to put on the lathe: this tool that we borrowed from the wheelwrights is for daily use; it is used by putting the piece in a vice, or by pressing it against the stomach.

*** SECTION IV. Du Placage des Bois:

Veneering is the operation by which a piece of furniture, a lathe workbench, or any other carpentry work is covered with a sheet of precious wood.

The wood intended for this use is cut into extremely thin leaves; we lift 14, 16 and up to eighteen on an inch

The frame on which the veneer is applied must be constructed with all possible solidity, so that the wood which composes it has no effect when the work is completed: this is why it is good, when the assemblies are made, leave it to dry in a place where it will not be exposed to heat or humidity.

It is necessary to avoid in the construction of the frame, that there appears no standing timber on the outside, because the glue does not take as well on this direction as on the timber.

To repair the frame, we use the toothed plane which we pass in all directions, both to properly straighten the surfaces and to make rough edges which highlight the effect of the glue.

We will then prepare the bob of veneer which we cut into pieces following the contours of the piece, and we will start by adjusting the external parts both in length and width, by placing several points along the line against which the sheet of veneer must come together, both along the length and at the ends; Once this is done, wet the sheet on the facing side with lukewarm water or extremely clear glue. This operation aims to counterbalance Vçiïïet from the glue that is put on the other side, which would cause the veneer to warp.

When the sheet is thus wet, we coat it with somewhat consistent glue, as well as the frames which we have heated a little before, and we place it in place as quickly as possible; then we take the hammer, fig. 52, the tip of which is pressed strongly on the sheet, pushing it from the middle to the ends, so that there remains only what glue between the sheet and the frame is necessary to bring them together.

If you use very thin wood, you should not use a hammer which would inevitably puncture the sheet: you should replace it with a cloth pad or the palm of your hand, which you will also move over the entire surface in pressing hard and as quickly as possible. Or then cover the veneer with a piece of thick woolen cloth on which we will place wooden crosspieces to place hand presses, fig. 16 and 17, which will be placed on as many points as possible, and the glue will be allowed to dry for several days without disturbing anything.

We do not think it necessary to say more about the veneer; the principles that we have just given are enough to give an idea to amateurs, and we would go beyond the goal that we have proposed if we wanted to go into the detail of the various processes that we are obliged to use according to the different contours of the pieces. that we want to dump.

** CHAPTER IV. Manière de Travailler le Fer et le Acier.
*** SECTION I. Notice sur les Aciers.
We know that there are many types and qualities of steel. This article being one of the important branches of our commerce, we can give our readers some ideas on the choice that we must make, as well as on its origin and its nature.

No one is unaware that it is through cementation that the transformation of iron into steel takes place. This operation by which we obtain a metal so essential to the arts, and whose trade is so widespread, has always been and still is today the subject of research by manufacturers and scholars. Mr. Hassenfratz, professor of physics at the Polytechnic School, has written a work on this subject in four volumes in-4°, which has contributed not a little to clarifying it. The best steel factories are located in Sweden, England and Germany.

Swedish steel is widely used in certain departments of France, to sharpen large tools and make mowing scythes. In its qualities it approaches that of Styria in Austria.

The goodness of the steels of England is generally recognized, and one cannot deny the English Febricans a well-deserved praise; but what is not as generally known is that the good iron suitable for this manufacture does not come out of the mines of England, and that it is Sweden which supplies them all. The type which has contributed most to the reputation of English steel is molten steel, and particularly that of the manufacturers Huntsman and Marshall: nothing better can actually be done. Cast steel is used for fine cutlery, such as razors, surgical instruments, etc., and for many other precious articles and jewelry, because it has the advantage of taking the most brilliant polish , to give ezcellens tranchaas, and that in a word it is free from the defects that we encounter in all the others.

This steel can only combine with iron very difficultly, and by losing part of the qualities which make it preferred.

The Grand Duchy of Berg, Prussia and Austria also have considerable steel factories whose products are exported almost throughout Europe, even to England. Their price is very moderate: they are soft, easy to file, and are particularly suitable for common cutlers, edgers, mechanics, locksmiths, etc. They are known in the trade under the names of Hungarian Steel and Ponte Cloth: the greatest consumption is in France.

The French government felt the full importance of this construction; they encouraged it in every possible way. In recent years, several establishments have been formed in the kingdom, the first attempts of which bode well for the happiest successes in the future.

*** SECTION II Description de la Forge et des Outils à forger.

Since amateurs do not usually have the facility to build a large forge which they would moreover rarely have occasion to use, we are going to point out to them a portable forge, very convenient, and which combines the advantage of be able to weld and quench with a lamp, a blowtorch and the wind of the bellows.

Fig. I, Pl. 10, represents this forge: A is the hearth, B the bellows which moves by a pedal C; the wind is carried to the nozzle by conduit D. Fig.2 represents this same forge seen from behind, and fig. 3 shows the geometric plan.

La-fig. 4 is an anvil mounted on its block placed on a doormat. .

Fig. 6 is the bucket full of water in which all the tools are cooled, and where the bottle brush, fig, 7, is dipped, which is used to wet the exterior of the hearth, to prevent the heat from escaping. . It is also in this vase that we wet the hammer to adorn the piece and rid it of the oxide produced on its surface by the fire.

Figs. 8 and 9 are the two pokers which are used to set the fire.

Fig. 10 represents a straight pliers, tightening to grip the flat parts.

Fig. 11 represents a crooked pincer, suitable for gripping round pieces.

Fig. 12 is a simple round pincer, intended to grip a short, cylindrical part that you want to force back.

Fig. 13 is a crooked, square pliers, which is used to grip a bolt on the side of the head.

Fig. 14, called Flat Hook, is used to grip long, flat or square bars.

Fig. 15 is called Greedy pincer, because it grips round or square pieces at the end, when they are short: all these pincers vary in size and strength, depending on the work we propose to carry out.

The esse A is slipped on the brandies of the pincers when you want to tighten the piece more firmly.

Fig. 16 represents the hand hammer, used for parrying; there are different sizes.

Fig. 17 is the hammer to strike in front, the. fig. 18 is another whose tip is in the axis of the handle, and is used to unclog.

Fig. 19 is a slice for cutting hot iron. The one for cold cutting has the same shape; but the angle of the cutting edge is more obtuse: which makes it stronger. These gouge-shaped tools are made to clear circular parts.

Fig. 20 is a round flush or disgorger, used to trim the fillets and bases.

Fig. 21 is a square and bevel chase. We make others whose face is flat. These tools are intended for making shoulders, removing threads, and trimming all parts where the hammer would not easily reach.

Fig. 22 shows a punch used to drill round holes; it comes in all shapes and sizes, ABCDE. There are punches which do not fit, and which are held by hand when the pieces are small.

The figs. 33 and 34 represent two nail cutters, one with square holes, the other with round holes: the shape of these tools is invariable; the holes alone vary in size and shape, both inside and in the upper orifice, as can be seen in the two small figures A and B.

Fig. 25 and 26 are flat, circular hot cutting scissors.

Fig. 27 is a punch for marking on the hot or cold iron your points where you want to cut or pierce the part.

The double stamp, fig. 28, is used for rounding. We make some that carry moldings to form hot bases, vases and other omemens.

Fig. 30 is a triangular stamp, without which no part of this shape could be forged.

Fig. 31 is a small slice which is placed, like the stamps which we have just destroyed, in the hole of the anvil. It is used to hot cut small parts.

Fig. 29 is a stamp with several flutes, semi-circular, and of various sizes. It lies flat on the anvil, and is fixed there by means of two flanges and two keys.

Fig. 32 is a strong ferrule which elevates the pieces when they are pierced: it prevents the tip of the punch from touching the anvil.

Fig. 33 shows the blowtorch, arranged to be placed on the forge. Using the blowtorch, fig. 34, the wind from the bellows is used to temper, to weld, and to stain the glass. This lamp can also be used with the mouth, using an ordinary blowtorch.

Fig. 35 is the press for arranging the wick which must be very large, and of which we only light a portion proportionate to the degree of heat we want to obtain.

There is still a large quantity of blacksmithing tools; but those that we have just described seem sufficient for the use that an amateur can make of them.

*** SECTION III. Notons élémentaires sur l'Art de Forger.

After having given some details on the different species of steel, and on the tools used in the forge, we judged it useful to give amateurs some principles on the art of forging, since, in an infinity of circumstances, they find it necessary to use various metals, particularly iron and steel.

We know that the art of forging consists of giving the iron all shapes, either by drawing the pieces from a bar, or by forming them. several pieces joined together by the action called welding.

You must first choose iron of a dimension appropriate to that of the piece you are undertaking, and also consider the use for which it is intended. For example, if this piece must withstand some effort, it will be necessary to use the softest irons, known in Paris under the name of Fers de Berri, and in the opposite case, it is necessary to use common irons: their pores being less open and less ashy, they are likely to acquire a more beautiful polish.

If the piece you want to farge can be placed in the bar, it will be enough to reheat it well and sparkle; then it will be brought to the anvil to hit it with short, accelerated blows until it becomes cherry color. This first operation brings the parts of the iron together, welds them and destroys the cracks.

Then we will begin to give the piece the determined shape: if it must receive a head, a base or any other bulge, we will prepare a shell with carne or flat iron; and we will take care that its circumference is a little less than that of the piece it must embrace. Therefore, its two ends will be a little far from each other. After having placed it in the place where it must be welded, we will put everything back on the fire; we will give a hot one, as the first time, with the precaution of placing the piece in the fire, so that it also heats well. Each time we turn it over, we will sprinkle it with soft, crushed stoneware. This vitrifiable material guarantees the part that is welded, from the sulfurous parts which are released from the coal, from the ash which, by being introduced between the joints, would harm their adhesion, finally from the action of the fire which often alters the surfaces by oxidizing them.

When the piece has the indicated degree of heat, we will place it on the anvil, the two ends of the ferrule above, and we will strike it from right to left, with small blows, and quickly, until the joints are brought together and welded. If we were not sure that the weld was complete, we could give it a second heat and operate as the first time.

The point of the part where the ferrule should be welded, will be held stronger than the rest, because this operation reduces the thickness of the iron by lengthening it. You can obtain the desired size by pushing back this part.

We call repressing the actian of striking: a piece at the end and parallel to its axis. It is easy to understand that by beveling the portion you want to bulge, and leaving the ends cold, the hot parts will yield to the action of the hammer.

We achieve the same goal by letting the piece fall from arm's height perpendicularly on the anvil, or often on a pile of steel placed on your terpe, at the level of the workshop floor.

To forge a cylindrical piece, he had to add to the general precaution of re-pressing it well, that of preparing it first squarely, then at eight, sides, and not rounding it with a hammer, passing it through a stamp, only when it is reduced to the determined size.

There are a large number of parts, such as a bolt, whose head is formed without inserting a ferrule. It is enough, when completing the stem, to preserve, at the end which must form the head, the size and length sufficient to fold it down. This almost white part is heated: the stem is inserted into a nail box of suitable size; then we crush, with a hammer, the excess part, to the desired thickness and width. It is essential to strike well; because forgetting this precaution causes the heads to come sideways.

We are now going to show how to join together two pieces of iron, what is called hot welding.

We start by caufing the ends which must be welded; we swell them by pushing them back; then, with the hammer, we crush the ends giving them the shape of a very obtuse angle which we call Primer, and of which we give a model fig. 36. When the two pieces are thus arranged, heat them equally well together, or if they are too bulky, separately, with the precautions detailed below, They will be removed from the fire when they are at the indicated heat point, by shaking strongly to rid them of the vitrified materials and the oxide with which they are covered. We will place the first part on the anvil, the primer on top, and we will apply the other part exactly on it; then, with a hammer of proportionate force, strike lightly and sharply. This operation must be carried out as quickly as possible so as not to give the iron time to cool down. When we are sure of its welding, we will chain it again to trim it.

*** SECTION IV. Procédés pour Souder le Fer avec l'Acier.

If we propose to make a tool whose steel is between two irons, such as a clasp, we will choose a flat iron bar which we will dry by giving it several curves of a very bright red: we will It will stretch to about half the thickness it must maintain: after which, we will prepare a piece of steel of the same caliber, and whose length will be half of the tool we want to make. We will then heat the bar, and we will bend it in the shape of tweezers, approximately to the length of the steel bead. We will enclose the latter between the two iron branches, which we will bring as close as we can. In this state, we will put the bar back on the fire, and we will heat it until white, taking care to turn it from time to time, so that the heat spreads equally everywhere: which is very essential to the success of the 'operation. When it is red-white and slightly sparkling, we will place it on the anvil, and we will strike it with small repeated blows to effect the soldering. If the bar were too long to be able to be welded with a single heat, the operation would be repeated as many times as necessary. The bar thus welded, all that remains is to stretch it to bring it into caliber and give it the appropriate shape, taking care to only heat it to a very bright red

There are special tools, and therefore unlikely to wear out, to which it is enough to weld a steel insert on the end or on the side, depending on the need. In either case, you must prepare the steel setting in the following way: after having forged it to the appropriate size, you must remove with a chisel a few lugs on the angles of the face that you proposes to join with the iron, and cut it to length. In this state, it will be immersed in water where it will take a fairly strong temper.

After having heated the iron bar on which you want to weld the steel to a very bright red, you will place the steel on the anvil, the lugs in the air; we will then bring the hot bar with the precaution of cleaning the surface to be welded very quickly; we will place the bar with great care on the steel, and we will hit it with one or two blows with a hammer, so that the lugs penetrate the iron and can attach themselves there. This done, we will put the bar back in the fire, the steel placed underneath, and we will heat it to the point and with the precautions indicated; we will then bring it back on an anvil, the steel placed on top, and we will strike it quickly, only with small blows; after which, we will put it back on fire again to reheat it and finish welding it: all that will remain is to give it the shape and length we need.

If the steel stake had to be at the end of the iron bar, it would be necessary, after having prepared it, as for the previous operation, to present the bar perpendicularly to the stake, and to strike on its upper end. The bar will remove the bet, and we will strike two or three blows with the bar as if we wanted to push back. It will then be heated to the degree prescribed above; we will bring it back on the anvil, and, with a medium hammer, we will strike with small blows on the end of the steel stake and in the axis of the bar; we will heat it again, and we will give it the desired shape, by hitting the end and the other faces.

*** SECTION V. Précauiions à prendre pour Forger les différentes espèces d'Acier.

To make a tool entirely in steel, if you use German steel, or Pont fabric, you must take a bar a little stronger than the tool should be, and rework the part with great care intended to make the cutting edge, because these steels are quite often open at the heart: what workers call strawy.

The bloated steel which comes from England, and which is much superior to that of Germany, can only heat up to a bright red; if we heated it to white heat, it would disintegrate under the hammer. It must therefore be struck gently when it comes out of the fire, and gradually increased as it cools. At the last heat, it can be forged almost black: which tightens the pores, and gives it a quality approaching that of the molten steel. It can, like German steel, be welded with iron, but with the precautions that we have just indicated.

Newcastle steel, marked with the double spur, is used for the same purposes and in the same way; only it tolerates more heat.

Cast steel, the best of all, is to be preferred wherever it can be used. You should only heat it to cherry color, and beat it as cold as possible. The cutlers, who have the most reputation for razor blades, after having forged and annealed their blades, end up cold forging them; which gives nerve to the steel, and prevents it from being brittle. Cast steel cannot be advantageously replaced by any other in the tools which are used to turn the roelaaxes: but we cannot highly recommend that it be made with the greatest supervision; because a degree of heat above the cherry color would oxidize it, and it would disintegrate under the hammer.

The notions that we have just given on forging seem to us to be sufficient for the goal that we have proposed. In the following section we will give the various means of annealing and softening iron and steel.

*** SECTION VI. Divers procédés pour Recuire et pour Adoucir îe fer et l'Acier.

To anneal and soften all the pieces of iron and steel that we want to file and turn, we use several materials, such as white chalk, iron filings, powder; but the best is coal dust, which, having the property of softening, and at the same time hardening, thereby increases the quality of the steel. We prepare a bunch of iron, with a capacity equal to twice the volume of the pieces of iron or steel to be annealed, and the lid of which must fit exactly. We pile charcoal, and we sift a sufficient quantity of it ; we put a first layer of one inch thick at the bottom of the box, and we arrange the pieces on top so that they do not touch each other. We cover them with a new bed of coal, and we continue like this until the bundle is full, and so that the last pieces are covered with a layer about 6 lines thick. This done, we close the boot, and we bind it with two wire ties; we leave the oven floor, or any other refractory earth, with which we coat all the surfaces of the boot, but particularly the joints. It will then be sprinkled with wood grain to remove humidity and prevent the earth from fading. This has two advantages: firstly it prevents air from entering the box, and consequently the combustion of the chain; secondly he preserved it from the action of fire. These preparations being completed, we put the bundle in a furnace proportioned to its volume, or even in an ordinary chimney, with a surround of bricks to contain the coal. We store both coals, half lit and half black, and we let it set without blowing: we keep the fire going for several hours, depending on the strength of the bundle. Moreover, we risk nothing by leaving it an fire too long; because, far from deteriorating, the pieces that are annealed can only acquire quality. When we judge that the package is sufficiently annealed, let the heat drop and cool everything without disturbing anything. The operation thus completed, we open the box, and remove the pieces which should be a bluish gray. If the box was well cleaned, the dust must not have suffered any kind of alteration, and can be used several times, for the same purpose.

*** SECTION VII De lu Trempe à feu découvert

TO TEMPE steel means to heat it to a lower and lower temperature, and to cool it quickly, either by immersing it in cold water, or by immersing it in another substance. The steel acquires, through this operation, a hardness and a fragility that it did not have before, and which form its main characteristics.

The degree of heat must vary according to the different species of steel: those from Germany and Hungary require to be heated to a bright red to acquire, through quenching, a certain degree of hardness; the bloated steel, and that marked with the double spur, take on the hardness by heating them to a light enrise color; the molten steel retains its qualities and becomes very hard by heating it to a cherry-brown color.

The greatest difficulty, when steeping over an open fire, is to heat well; for lack of this attention, the parts warp, and sometimes break, because, the cooling, produced by water or any other substance, being uniform, the parts most dilated by the heat do not tighten as quickly as the others . The safest way is to heat slowly, moving the piece around and turning it in all directions. We can also use, for this purpose, charcoal in a stove, without blowing, ensuring that the charcoal is distributed equally, and covers the pieces exactly.

Before immersing a part in water, it is necessary to ensure that it is of a very even red in all the parts which must receive the quenching: it is the shape of the parts which determines the manner of immersing them in the water. For example, if we want to temper a lathe tool, such as a chisel or a gouge, we must, after having heated it with the precautions that we have indicated, remove it from the fire without hitting it. plunge it slowly and perpendicularly into the water, and wait for it to cool without shaking it: if the tool was made of iron and steel, you would need to be extra careful, because it would warp more easily. The reason for this is easy to design: steel and iron, not being equal in density, do not equally release the caloric they contain, and consequently the iron part is cooled sooner than the steel part. We will give, in the following Section, how to straighten parts warped by quenching.

The way of tempering molten steel tools, which are used for turning metals, differs from the previous one. We will give as examples the hooks suitable for turning iron, fig. 14, 15, 16, Pl. 14, Volume one. After having given them the shape indicated by the figure, they are put into the fire from the back, so that the side of the cutting edge only receives the heat through the reddening of the back; When the tool is red-cherry-brown, immediately immerse it in water by the cutting edge, and leave it there to cool. The barley grain fig. 16 is the only one of these tools that it is necessary to return because of the fragility of its tip.

There are an infinite number of tools, such as small chisels, squares, etc., which must be hardened throughout their length because they wear out to the end without being reheated. These small parts are very difficult to heat also because of their extreme tenuity. Often they even get burned and disappear in the fire. Many people heat them in coal dust which they use following the process we have indicated for annealing. But the hardness that they acquire through this new cementation makes them extraordinarily cassani: here is a simple and safe way to heat them well without fear of ever passing the appropriate heat level. We obtain a cylindrical sheet metal box, deep enough to hold the pieces upright; we place it in a small furnace, and we melt lead up to three quarters of the height of the box: after which we put the tools in it. We heated it, everything very red, and when we noticed that the lead was beginning to oxidize on the surface, we grabbed the pieces with pliers by the silk to immerse them in the water perpendicularly as we did. we said above. This method of soaking prevents the pieces from settling on the surface, provides them with an even degree of heat, and keeps them straight.

It is essential to anneal all the outibs which must be tempered, not only to make them softer with the file, but also to destroy the tension which the action of the hammer, in forging them, has produced on their surfaces.

Drills, small taps, or other parts that are only one line thick, and even less can be quenched with a blowtorch. We grasp the piece with pliers, and we direct with the wind of the blowtorch the flame of the candle or a lamp on the extremity that we want to soak. When it reaches the degree of dialer necessary according to the quality of the steel, if the piece is very small, it is stuck in the candle; if it is a little strong, we immerse it in water. For this purpose, you must have near you a small vase filled with water. If the piece is too short to be grasped with pliers, or if you want to cut it whole, you will place it on a charcoal in which you will have made a hollow suitable for containing it. We will also heat it well, directing your flame on the coal, and we will throw it into the water. This method is also used to solder small parts with silver solder.

As for drills and other stronger tools, they must be heated in the forge with charcoal, carefully observing the color specific to each quality of steel, and immersed up to four or five lines above the pruning.

We often take advantage of the heat of the stem to bring back the soaked parts. This operation is difficult, unsafe, and one cannot hope to succeed when one does not have great experience. in this type of work.

*** SECTION VIII. Manière de faire Revenir les pièces d'acier trempées.

It almost always happens that pieces of steel hardened, either over an open fire, as we taught in the previous Section, or in bundles, as we will say in Section X, acquire, through this operation, too much hardness. large, which makes the tools too fragile. This hardness is reduced by returning them in the following way.

If the pieces have been filed before being hardened, they must be whitened with crushed emeril, diluted in oil, using a flat or half-round walnut wood polisher, depending on the shape of the pieces. . If, on the contrary, the pieces are raw, it is enough to give them a blow with a grinding wheel on one side: after which, they are degreased with dry tripoli, using a brush, or with hot ash.

This preparation having been completed, we arrange the fire in such a way as to receive the pieces which we wish to brown; if they are small, we will put them on a sheet of iron, and let them heat up until we see them change color. First they become the color of light straw, then yellow, pigeon-like, and finally blue: after the good, they take on a grey-toned color; but, at this point, the best steels are too soft. Tools intended for cutting wood, made with German steel, must be removed from the fire, and immersed in water when they are dull: the fine steel shafts must have turned blue.

The squares and chisels must be turned yellow, and in this state, immersed in oil; the taps, eoussinets, simple dies, etc., must be turned straw color.'

This is the place to give how to fire blue small parts, such as screws, springs and other luxury objects. Whether they are hardened or not, they must always be well polished, degreased, and polished with iron oxide, known commercially as Rouge de Engleterre, Potée d'étain or Noir à polish. In this state, we place them on a bath of sand heated in advance, to the point where we cannot hold our finger in it, and we arrange them so that they do not touch each other, and we can easily distinguish the various color changes that they experience, to be able to remove them with squeezers as soon as the blue color appears. They must be shaken in the air when removing them, and place them on a cold body, taking care not to touch them with fingers or other fatty substances, as long as they retain heat, which would make them resistant to heat. always.

If, despite the vigilance of the operator, a piece turns blue, it will have to be repolished and revived again to start again.

We can, in the operation that we have just described, replace the sand bath with well-burned lumps of tan in a vase.

*** SECTION IX Différens moyens de Redresser les pièces trempées.

TO straighten small parts, such as chisels and squares, we will seize the moment when they are still warm, and we will bend them on the side opposite to their curvature, forcing the concave part to become convex.

To do this, you must hold the silk with pliers, with your left hand, place the tip on a piece of wood, then press gently and very lightly on the top of the curvature which Fod thus forces to return.

If the piece is a little strong, and the power of the hand is insufficient, it is necessary to make three small blocks of wood, or better copper, bent squarely; we will place two of them on the fixed middle of the vice, spaced apart by the length of the part to be straightened, and the third on the middle of the movable jaw.

The part being hot, we fix it lightly between these three points, so that the convex part is on the side of the movable jaw, and we extend the vice gently, until the part is straight and even a slightly curved in the opposite direction. Do not remove it from the vice until it has completely cooled.

Strong pieces, flat or square, are straightened with a sharp hammer. This instrument, for the manufacture of which the best steel is used, has two points in opposite directions. Each of these purlins is shaped like a short bevel chisel. We strike with short blows, and transversely to the length of the piece, on the concave surface until it has become straight. If the piece is flat and thin, and it is curved on its side, to straighten it, strike alternately on each of the edges of the hollow part. This is how all cutlery works are straightened out.

In closing this article, we repeat that great precautions are necessary in the use of the different means that we have indicated; if we neglected them, we would run the risk of breaking the parts that we wanted to straighten.

*** SECTION X. De la Trempe en paquet.

SOAK in pack means to harden, using a hammer, the surfaces of steel or iron parts, after they are completely finished. We will give the most common means for this operation.

For steel parts and iron parts of a small volume, coal dust is used as cement. We enclose the parts in a sheet metal box, arranged, like those we talked about in the article on annealing; and when they are hot, they are immersed in the cnu with the precautions already indicated.

For strong iron parts, or for those composed of iron and steel, we use chimney soot: the best, for this use, is crusted soot, thick and heavy, greasy and shiny, which is incorrectly called 'calcined soot. To use it successfully, it must be subjected to the action of fire, in a tin box where it ferments and bubbles up to double its volume. When it has thus had its effect, we remove it from the heat, we let it cool, and we pulverize it as finely as possible. We recommend calcining a certain quantity at a time, to use it as needed, because this operation gives off an unpleasant odor.

This way of preparing the soot, before using it, has other advantages. By calcining, it loses none of its quality; only it no longer ferments when used, and there is no longer any risk of it escaping through the seals of the box, which, although well closed, can break and allow air to enter the package: which oxidizes the pieces, eats them away, and can lose them entirely if they are engraved.

You can replace the soot with old burnt leather, horn (horse's foot is preferable), and bones. The horn must be charred like soot, and pulverized as fine as possible.

Calcined bones give, in general, an excellent cement. Calcined and pulverized sheep bones, as we have just said, and used without mixing, produce on pieces that we do not want to polish after tempering, a kind of moire. , of a silver-grey color very pleasant to the eye. This is how, for example, some luxury weapons end.

Some people mix these various cemens and add salt, urine and garlic. These substances, far from adding anything to the quality of the cement, essentially harm the perfection of the parts, causing the surfaces to blister, and deteriorate the steel instead of improving it.

Ordinarily the pieces soaked by these various processes are pickled in vinegar, especially those which are engraved, or whose color we do not want to change.

When the pieces are arranged in the box, it is placed in a furnace, arranged for this use, or, quite simply, in an surround of bricks, made in a chimney, as we indicated in the article on annealing . It is difficult to determine the time required to heat the package to the proper degree; three or four hours are usually enough, but as the precise degree of heat is very essential to the goodness of the temper, here are the main means that we use to recognize it.

In general, the mass becomes a bright, shiny red; we see a small bluish flame rising above the package; but, for greater safety, you can put in the package a piece of strong iron wire, which comes out on the outside, and which you can remove at will. When we see it has become a beautiful bright red, we will soak it, and we will touch it immediately with a file. This way, we will know the degree of hardness of the parts that we want to harden.

When we are sure of the degree of heat of the pieces contained in the package, we will open it: we will then take the pieces, one after the other, with long forceps or whiskers, fig. 17, PL 16, and they will be immersed in water with the precautions already indicated. We will be careful not to say, with some artists, that it is absolutely necessary. use very cold water for quenching. On the contrary, we have acquired the certainty that lukewarm water is more suitable than any other for this operation. Since it has been used to temper the dies and squares of coins, we hardly break any more, whereas previously we lost more than half of them.

If we were obliged to retouch a part, after having dipped it in a package, it would be necessary to anneal it in coal dust, as we have indicated, and then reheat it in the same dust to re-dip it for a second. times: with this precaution, the steel will lose none of its quality.

*** SECTION XI. Des différentes qualités des Limes.

BEFORE giving the nomenclature and description of the different species of files, we believe we will interest our readers by letting them know the different countries where they are made. The fairly extensive trade that we do in this type allows us to go into some details on their forms, their qualities and their uses.

England, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands have file factories, which send them to France, where, however, a very large quantity is produced today.

The factories of England, although justly renowned, do not yet supply all kinds of them. The English are obliged to have recourse to the factories of a part of Germany, to obtain the files known under the name of Needle File* used in goldsmithing, jewelry and jewelry.

The low price, rather than the good quality of the files manufactured in various cantons of Switzerland, makes them sought after for many small works, and especially for watchmaking. The longest, known commercially, do not exceed six inches. Their size is fairly regular, but they are too tender to resist on the iron.

German files, made in Prussia and the Duchy of Berg, are generally known only as common files. They are stuffed and sold in packs which contain one to six. Each package weighs 6 or 7 quarter pounds, regardless of how many limes it is made of. They have four specific shapes, flat, half-round, three-quarter, and round. Locksmiths particularly use it; Mechanics also use it to rough out or rough out their work.

Southern Germany supplies other stuffed files, known as Limes de Stf^rie. These are of much higher quality. Manufacturers of pendulum springs and copper workers do not use any others, although their prices are much higher than those of the preceding ones.

Saint Etienne, in Forez, Iberian for a long time; but they are less widespread in commerce. Their color is black, steel is common, and they can only be used on copper and for rough work. It is surprising that the manufacturers of this country which everything seems to favor have not further perfected this important production.

For several years there have been lime manufactures in France similar to those in England, and known under the name of bastard limes, semi-sweet and sweet, of which a considerable quantity is consumed, particularly in Paris.

The most important establishment of this type is that of Mr. Saint-Bris, in Amboise, to whose success the government has contributed greatly. Its files are well shaped, well cut, and can, in several cases, replace those of England. If they have not yet reached all the perfection that can be desired, they are getting closer every day, and there is everything to hope for from the talents and intelligence of the head of this factory.

Mr. Kaoul, and Mr. Remoad, in Paris, each have an establishment where they manufacture small files from 1 inch to 5, which surpass all those known to date.

It is unfortunate for the progress of industry that Mr. Baoul did not believe it necessary to give more scope to his factory; the skills he showed for this important production would soon have put him in a position to compete with England.

*** SECTION XII. Nomenclature des différentes espèces de Limes.

Files of similar shape have the same name, whatever their size. This size being proportional to the length, it is by the number of inches that they carry on this last dimension that they must be designated. So, we will ask for a flat hand file, 8, 10 and 12 inches. You should also know that there are in each species and in each length, rough, blunt, semi-soft and soft files.

We call a flat motn file, that which, on an average thickness, presents a fairly considerable width according to its strength, and almost equal from one end to the other to a twelfth of the length: it is cut on three sides; the fourth is smooth, and this smooth part is often very useful. Suppose that having finished a shoulder on a piece, we want to reduce its size, it is important to file only on the flat, and not to touch the side: in this case, the part Hase rubs and smoothes the one which is not doesn't want to file, while we work on the other one.

When you have made a slot with a saw, or otherwise, and you want to make it regular, straighten it or deepen it, you use a kind of thin file, cut on all the edges, which we call Lime to equalize.

To split the screw heads, we use a file called a splitting file, which has the shape of two knives leaning against each other.

The splitting file is used for the same purpose; this is extremely thin, equal in thickness, and cut on the fields and on the edges only

When we are ready to square a trow, we use a four-quarter file, ending in a point.

To enlarge a round hole, we use a round HMT, or rat's tail.

The entry file is cut like the hand flat file; but e41e is thicker, narrower, and ends in a point.

When, in some opening that we want to extend or deepen, an entry file cannot insinuate itself, we use the pointed flat file, which is wider, thinner, and cut on all four sides.

The three-quarter file, which is used to sharpen saws, as well as has many other uses, and which is called, among workers. Third point, presents an equilateral triangle; it is cut on its three sides, and ends in a point.

We are sometimes obliged to make a clearance, fillet or quarter round, in moldings: a pointed round file does not make the groove even; and, in this case, we use the round file equal from one end to the other.

We profile a rounded hollow part, with half-round files.
 
In mechanics, we round the teeth, with files which only attack the tooth we are dealing with, and do not cut into the neighboring ones: for this we use files cut on the flat, rounded above and smooth. , and equal throughout their length: they are called rounding files.

When we want to make a slide, we use a kind of file cut on three sides, smooth along its entire length; and as it is used to elect the square part of a diarnière, apart from the chamons, on which rests such part made on the lid, it is called Chanton file. This file is very narrow in relation to its length, and almost equal in thickness,

There is yet another species of file, which has the effect of two half-round files, which are joined to one another by the flat, and which is called Limê with two round backs.

To follow a curved part, we use a type of file called a sage leaf. There are different curvatures; and even each of them has two different curvatures.

We call pillar files those which are intended for the pillars in watches. They look like a hand held plastic file, except that they are smaller and narrower.

We sometimes need to form an angle whose two sides are very straight: we use this. this with a knife file, as when it comes to digging an angle less than forty-five degrees.

Watchmakers thin the faces of a gear to hollow it out a little in relation to its stem: they call those they use for this purpose Limes to thin. These files are similar to the previous one, but a little thicker and rounded by the back which is not cut.

As a result of the previous operation, to complete and polish a pivot throughout its length, up to the angle which forms the side of a pinion, we use a kind of soft file whose cut is a trapezoid : it is called pivot file.

The sliding file is a flat file, equal in thickness, rounded on its two fields, and whose flats are not cut. We use it to make the groove in which we place and weld the sockets of a hinge.

The rifloîr is a kind of file or rasp cut at two ends which are curved in one direction opposite one to the other. There are all shapes, that is to say round, half-round, triangular, etc.; it is used to repair parts where the file cannot reach. Sculptors and carvers also make great use of it.

There are an infinity of other files whose detail would take too long, but which are only generally used in a few particular arts.

** CHAPTER V. Divers Procédés pour le Moulage et la Ponte des Métaux.

OUR intention here is not to provide a treatise on the art of the foundryman. A complete description of this art would require too great a detail, and would take us away from our plan; but we only wanted to give amateurs some notions which could be useful to them in an infinity of circumstances, and to enable them to appreciate the works of this kind which they think they might be in the position of having performed.

The simplest and most efficient method of using molds for casting lead, copper, and in general all metals, is that known under the name of casting in sand, the processes of which we are going to describe.

We will sift enough sand, which we will wet slightly; then, on a table, we will handle it and turn it over, with a rolling pin similar to that of pastry chefs, until it is equally moist, and no longer has any lumps. We will make two frames of oak barrels, of sufficient size and thickness, to contain the length and thickness of the piece we want to cast. These frames are nothing other than a square frame, of four pieces, assembled with tenons and mortises, which are placed one on top of the other, and are assembled there, by means of two or four dowels, which hold to a frames, and enter a little freely into the other.

We place on a table the one of these frames which does not have dowels: we fill it with founder's sand, because the operation that we are describing here is that of the copper founder; we place the piece that we want to mold there, so that when removing it it does not scratch the hollow that it will have left in the sand. We will make sure, between the piece and the table, there is enough depth of sand so that the mold does not burst in this place. When the piece is well placed, we will place the second frame on this first, inserting the dowels into their own holes, so that the wood corresponds exactly. We will also fill this frame with sand, which we will beat are more careful than the first. Then, with a sword or foil blade, or a wooden ruler, to which we will have a sharp bevel, we will scrape off all the sand which exceeds the surface of the frame. We will cover this surface with a board, and we will turn the whole thing over; then we will raise the first frame (we lay down); we will break the sand it contains, to put it back again, when it is in place. You must take care, before starting this operation again, to clean the surface of the first mold well, and to create new hollow marks in the places which are not occupied by the jet or by the vents; we will sprinkle everything with charcoal, so as to blacken the entire surface, then, with a bellows and from a certain distance, we will clean the mold. This second half completed, we will carefully separate the two frames, so that the piece leaves without in any way scratching the contours of the void it will leave, and we will place them gently and upright against a wall, or elsewhere, out of the blows that we could give them in passing, which would destroy all the work in an instant.

We will remove, with the same precaution, the part from inside the second frame, and if, despite the care we have taken, there is some scratch, place it, or put the part back, after having placed it in its hollow a little coal dust, or cleanly repair the scratches with fingers and suitable small tools, and restore the altered shape to the hollow.

We will make, with the blade of a knife, or even with a soaked blade, to which the end has been given the shape of a poorly closed o, a gutter which extends from the hollow to the top of the mold, whose wood, in this place, must be slightly flared at each frame to give entry to the material.

Nothing is so common with pieces thrown into a mold as to find vents or blowholes, which are small cavities, both on the surface and inside the piece, if it is a little thick. . This defect comes from two causes; or because the air is enclosed in the material, or because, the mold being still a little humid, this humidity reduced to vapor by the great <^&leur of the material, cannot escape from the mold, and there necessarily occupies a place. To avoid these inconveniences, we will make, at some distance from the jet, another channel, placed on the highest point, which also extends to the top, and which serves as a vent; and if the room was of a shape such that the place where we would make the vent was full before the whole hollow was, it would be necessary to make one or more others: but they must be very small. By this means, od will be assured that the piece will come clean and flawless.

We will then put the molds to dry, over a small charcoal fire made on the tile, pressing the molds against each other, and turning them upside down from time to time. In large workshops we have ovens intended for this operation.

When we want to pour, we will pass a little fine ash, diluted in water, into the molds; we will replace the frames one on the other, and we will tighten them between two boards or planks, by means of ropes, or better still, screws. Copper founders use a press for this, in which they take several frames to pour the material into each, one after the other.

However dry the mold is, the safest thing to do is to heat it. The matter, not being seized by the cold, flows and expands better: moreover the air contained therein being already dilated, enters into a lesser expansion.

Copper smelters have furnaces built expressly to place the crucible which contains their metal. These furnaces are square in shape, and separated into two parts by an iron plate from which the four corners are cut off. The lower part or pit receives the wind from the sulphur, and transmits it to the upper part which contains the crucible and the coal.

Amateurs, who usually only have small objects of this kind to make, can replace this furnace, by arranging their forge in the following way. We will place on the ashtray, about an inch from the back and opposite the nozzle of the bellows, a piece of brick, to receive the crucible, and we will surround the crucible, thus placed, with a strip of iron of the same height, and curved in a semi-circle to contain the coal.

Goldsmiths and jewelers, who most often only have small pieces to cast, do not use other means.

After these arrangements, we will begin by heating the empty and covered crucible, to ensure if it can resist the action of the fire without splitting, and we will then throw into it material, broken into pieces, at approximately two third of its height. We will continue to heat, stirring the fire with the action of the bellows, until this first bath is completely molten. We will complete filling the crucible two or three times while always maintaining the heat, so that the material, in fusion, does not cool down by the action of that which we throw into it, and that we must always keep hot near the furnace: without this precaution the crucible would split.

When the crucible is full and the material is completely dissolved, we will shake everything with a stick to bring the heterogeneous bodies to the surface, which we will remove with a skimmer.

Before skimming, you can throw a pinch of glass salt into the crucible. This substance instantly seizes all the bodies, non-fusible at this degree of heat, suspended in matter, and carries them to the surface, where a vitreous layer is formed which is removed with the greatest ease. .

If we operated on gold, we would replace the glass salt with borax, the effect of which is more active; but the high price of this substance does not allow it to be used in large operations, nor for materials of little value.

Once the copper is thus molten and well foamed, we will grasp the crucible by its circumference with curved pincers, and we will pour the metal into the molds.

All of these processes can be used to melt lead and tin, but as these metals require much less heat to melt, they can be melted in an iron pot placed on an ordinary stove.

Lead should only be poured at sufficient heat; and, on this occasion, we will allow ourselves an interesting observation here.

Lead, tin, as well as all other metals, when exposed to too much heat, oxidize more or less, depending on their nature and the degree of heat they are subjected to. Heated moderately, lead produces on its surface a dirt, a foam or skin which is white. Tin produces the. same result. Heat carried a little further on the tin produces yellow; further still on the lead, it is red known under the name of minium.

These different effects are produced by the combination of oxygen with the metal in greater or lesser doses. If we therefore want to restore the metallic form of the oxides, we must remove the superabundant oxygen from them, and for this, we will mix them with powdered charcoal or some animal matter, such as fat, which has more affinity than metal with oxygen.

If we want to prevent the metal in fusion from oxidising in such a large quantity, we will throw a little fat or tallow, or coal dust, into the iron pot where the operation is carried out. ; these substances, lighter than the metal, rise to its surface, cover it, and prevent it from absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere.

When the operation is finished, let the piece cool in the mold, because if it is still hot, it will break very easily.

If your piece is likely to be put on the Lathe, we will turn it with the precautions indicated in the place where we will teach how to fill the wheels of spinning wheels with lead.

Almost all the details into which we have just entered belong to the art of the foundryman. We need not say more about this art, which requires special utensils, and which entails an inanity of operations foreign to our subject. The melting furnace is constructed in such a way that it can only be used for this: it requires a much larger bellows than that required for an average forge: finally, unless the melting is large, the operation is well more costly than when melted by the worker who only engages in this type of work.

We will end this article by recommending drying the molds well: the slightest humidity not only causes the operation to fail, but even becomes fatal for the artist. We know that a drop of water suddenly reduces its steam, increasing its volume to four or five hundred. If therefore a little humidity remains in the aul, and the heat of the lead reduces it to vapor, it wants to escape or occupy a larger space: but if some obstacle opposes it, it breaks all the barriers, and breaks everything that resists it, if, in a factory where an iron pipe is poured, the gutters are not heated enough, we see the material springing from all sides, removing the roof, breaking the roof which surrounds it. , and threaten the lives of all the assistants, who find no other resource than in flight.

The sand, which the founders use, comes from Fonttenai-aux-Roses, a village near Paris. It is yellow, greasy to the touch, and fits very well; but we have noticed that it becomes better, when it has already undergone a few melts, than when it is clean: it is customary to mix it with old, and, through this mixture, all of them become better; the old is rejuvenated, and the new is softened; because the founders assure that, in brand new sand, the pieces are prone to splitting when cooling: moreover, this observation can only concern copper casting.

When we melt works with a core, the operation is much more difficult: we call core, the center of a piece which must be hollow; like the body of a figure, a pipe, etc. This core is made with such sand, and when the piece is melted, it is removed with a sword blade, or other pointed and sharp tool; but it is necessary to carefully remove all the sand, both from the dedane and from the dbors, since nothing damages the files and tools of Tour so much.

When we want to cast a piece, which must be hollow, the model must be made in a particular way, and with great care. Suppose it is a pipe; and this example will suffice for all other cases: we will turn a cylinder of wood, of the external size that we want to give to the pipe, and even two lines more or thereabouts, because the material shrinks as it cools; We will give it a length of about 6 inches more than the pipe, and on each end of this tube, we will mark a length of about 3 inches, and we will reduce it, from the two marks to at each end, to the interior thickness of the pipe, as if the small cylinder had been passed through a pipe. The founder will cast this cylinder in the sand; then he will form, with such sand, a core, the size of the small cylinder, and place it right in its place. We understand that in the middle there remains an empty part which the material will fill, and that by removing the core, the pipe will find itself weighed further and further. There are even cases where the large cylinder is drilled at the Lathe, and it is turned on a smaller cylinder which just fits into it. This method is preferable to the first for small objects only, in that it helps the founder to mold the core with more accuracy.

If the core did not have to pass further into the piece, we would form a core of wood, which could enter into the model, and we would leave the span longer than the portion placed in the model: the founder would make it similar made of sand, and as it would have a certain length, it would hold sufficiently in its place, although held by only one end, the other end remaining in the air, in the center of the void, which the model would have formed.

Foundry sand, when sifted a little fine, renders the ornaments on a piece quite well; but we can never obtain enough clarity so that we do not need to repair with chisels the pieces that we need to decorate, or that we want to be clean. Moreover, if the omemens are very fine, and have little protrusion, it is rare that they come very clean. Workers, and even artists, express this lack of clarity with the word blur: this piece comes blurred; it doesn't come clean. There are certain expressions in the arts, the origin of which we do not know, the meaning of which we do not understand, and to which we have nevertheless attached an idea, which everyone adopts. So, to say that a painting is vaporous, that it is not dry and thin, painters convey this idea, by blowing a little and swinging their hand as if to paint the vapor.

When you want a piece to be very clean, down to the smallest ornaments, you use tripoli instead of sand; we put it into powder, and pass it through a very fine sieve. This powder combines the triple advantage of presenting a very even surface, of being imprinted in the smallest details, and of binding itself by means of a type of gluten, or creamy material, which can be felt just by touch. We have seen medals copied by this means, and which almost blended in with the original, in terms of sound, which molten matter can never acquire, and which only the work-hardening of the pendulum can provide.

It is also claimed that a fish bone, which we give to the canaries, is a very good material for melting very cleanly: we enclose, and we press strongly between two of these remains of fish, the piece which we wants to flow, and it is imprinted there instantly: but we do not guarantee this process, of which we have no experience.

** CHAPTER VI. Du Perçage des Bois, et du forage des Métaux.
*** SECTION I Outtils à percer le bois.

We only aim in this chapter to give you an elementary and general knowledge of the tools suitable for drilling, and we reserve ourselves, as we have promised, to provide examples of how to use them as we progress. the opportunity will present itself.

Fig. 7, Pl. 11. is the iron crankshaft with a wooden handle; this instrument, known to everyone, receives the bits for drilling wood and the tools suitable for enlarging holes, reaming and milling wood and metals. The small fig. B. shows the eye where the drill bit is placed and the pressure screw which attaches to it.

Fig. 6 shows another crankshaft whose body and handle are made of wood; the copper head pierced with a square hole A contains an internal spring to retain and fix the bits which are removed by pressing button B.

Fig. 20 represents your spoon bit for use by turners and carpenters. There are from half a line in diameter up to 8 lines and from 4 inches in length up to 6.

The fly wick, fig. 21, for the use of carpenters, is very good for drilling soft woods; but it is too fragile for hard woods, because the wick is insulated; they are of the same size as the previous ones.

We call augers, bits of the same shape, but much longer, which are up to two inches in diameter; these adapt to a transverse handle and proportionate to their strength.

The spoon and point bit, fig. 22, has the ability to drill precisely on a given point; it is used for this reason in precious objects.

Fig. 23 represents the three-pointed bit, called the angular bit, extremely useful for drilling crooked wood; it fixes very precisely, leaves the bottom of the hole almost flat, and never causes the wood to split or split, no matter how close to the edge of the hole you want to make. There are from 3 lines up to 18 lines wide. To combine all the advantages that we have just talked about, this wick must be executed with the greatest care. This is what made us decide to have them made in our workshops, and before our eyes.

Fig. 18 represents a conical bit, or ladle, semi-circular and hollow, suitable for growing a hole and giving it entrance. Their size varies like that of the other wicks.

Figs. 19, 24 and 25 are squares of different shapes: the first is semi-circular and conical; the second is five or six-sided and pyramidal, and the third which is of the same shape, presents along its length almost a parallel leg. Someone uses it to make a hole bigger or to round it.

Fig. 26 represents a screwdriver which mounts, like the bits, on a crankshaft, which gives it more force. We nevertheless recommend using it only for screws of a certain size.

Fig. 27 is a drill bit for drilling cut stone. There is some for hard stone and for soft stone.

The cooper's bit, fig. 28, is used to pierce barrels to place cinnamon.

Figs. 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 represent tools called countersinks, which tighten screw heads to sink. both in wood and in metals. Those intended for wood are larger in size to release dust more easily.

Fig. 12 is a special cutter, for the use of luthiers; its construction makes it very useful when it is necessary to countersink a hole in an interior, for example, in the body of a flute. A is the cutter without a handle, B is the same, seen from the side of the slide; It is a flat iron rod, which decreases along its length with two bevels made on its two long sides; it enters with a dovetail in the groove of the cutter, and it is with this rod that we lead it towards the hole to be countersunk where we hold it while we screw the handle and the rod D.

*** SECTION II. Outils pour percer les métaux.

Fig. 2 is a simple drill. It went from half a line to 3 lines. These drills have different shapes depending on their destination; those for drilling copper have the shape of fig. 2, with a double bevel on each side. On the contrary, those intended to pierce iron, instead of having a point in the center, have only two semi-circular bevels.

As these drills use a lot of material and become cumbersome, when we want to be well matched, we have invented boxes or drill holders of all shapes and sizes to make up for it.

Fig. 3 shows one of these simple drill holders. To make use of it, we rely, as with others, on a conscience, fig. 4 and 5, which is applied against the stomach; This instrument, although widely used, sometimes embarrasses people unaccustomed to using it.

Fig. 1 represents a drill holder to which a handle and a rod similar to those of the crankshaft have been adapted. We can, at any rate, pierce by pressing with the stomach, or in any position we wish, by applying pressure with the hand. Drills and countersinks fit into a square hole, and are held there by a screw.

Fig. 8 is a drill holder mounted on a tool holder commonly called Touret, this instrument is fixed on the prop by part A, or is mounted on the workbench by means of screw B. The drill is thus placed horizontally , we present him with the part to be drilled.

Figs. 10 and 29 are two needle holders or types of ring pliers, in which we grasp very small steel points from which we make drills suitable for drilling very fine holes. There are also shank needle holders, which fit onto the grinder fig. 8, which we have just discussed.

Fig. 11 is a core drill whose small copper box A flows over the stem and stops there by means of a pressure screw, to fix the depth of the cores. Dowel B enters the already drilled hole and serves as a guide; We have these studs of different sizes depending on the need.

The copper, fig. 31, is a kind of coil cut in the middle, the two parts of which are joined by two screws. This instrument is used to grip flat, round or square pieces of small diameter, to turn them or to drill them.

Fig. 32 is another copper where the part is held between four screws. We brick them in all sizes, and we must always proportion them to the parts we want to turn or drill. When you want to drill a piece using these coppers, one of the ends is carried by point A of the conscience fig. 5, and the end to be drilled is presented to the drill bit fixed to the vice or in any other way.

The different drills or drill holders that we are trying to describe are set in motion by means of bows, fig. 33 and 34; the one in fig. 34 has the advantage of being able to change blades.

We must take care to proportion the bows to the strength of the drills we want to use.

Fig. 9 is a tool called Drille, used by goldsmiths and jewelers, for drilling holes on large surfaces, or at degrees of inclination where the use of other drill holders would be too difficult; it receives, like all the boxes, drills and cutters of various sizes.

Figs. 35 and 36 are two universal handles, one round and the other flat. It is used to quickly and securely grip all kinds of files and tools which are fixed there by the pressure screw ji. With this tool, you can use files or other tools with broken tangs, an accident that happens quite often while working.

Fig. 30 is a kind of auger in the shape of an Archimedes screw. This tool is very convenient for drilling standing timber: it requires very little effort, and moves by itself; but you have to prime with a small bit to make it set.

** CHAPTER VII. Des Outils de Tour.
*** SECTION I. Des Outils pour le Bois.

Fig. 1, Pl. 12, represents a gouge for roughing out wood of all kinds. The perfection of this tool consists in that the groove is well dug, also hollowed out and erect, so that the bevel which is below, and which ends against the groove, can give the edge a regular shape, more or less elongated, depending on the need. We must have, in a laboratory, not only gouges of different sizes, from the largest, which are 8, lo and 12 lines wide, to the smallest, which are approximately 12 lines wide; but even gouges of the same kind, sharpened, some longer, and others shorter

Fig. 2 is a chisel, or plane, so named because it serves to erase the furrows that the gouge necessarily leaves, and to level the work. Its cutting edge is formed by the meeting of two bevels: which makes it called Clasp by certain workers, because of its resemblance to the carpenter's clasp, which has two bevels: nevertheless the Turners more commonly call it Chisel. You must have a certain quantity of them, of different widths, and several of the same width, of which you reserve a few which cut sideways, so as not to constantly go to the grindstone or the oil stone.

After these two tools, the only ones which are essentially suitable for the Lathe, if we consider it as the art of cutting wood circularly, come all the others which do not cut it, but scrape it. The first are what we call a single-sided chisel, which is used for turning hard wood, and which scrapes instead of cutting. We see one of medium width, fig. 3. There are many uglier ones, and always decreasing to very narrow ones, which we can call Beca-d'ane, able to make small squares in very narrow parts.

Figs. 4 and 5 are barley grains which are used to straighten hard wood at the end, to cut, with a sharp line, two pieces that we want to separate, or to mark a clearance between a stick and the body of a molding. They are of any width, according to the need and the place where they must enter. But, as those which are a little narrow would not have sufficient strength, if they were not thicker than the others, this thickness is increased, and they seem to be placed on the spot, so as not to bend at the slightest effort.

It is often necessary to dig grooves of all curvatures, and for this, one must be provided with several round chisels of different curvatures and widths, for all the places where they may be necessary. The one shown in fig. 6, is of average width. To avoid multiplying the boards, we have only collected one of each type.

Fig. 7 is a half-round chisel, for hollowing out parts of this shape, such as douciues or fillets, it is of as many widths as can be desired.

Fig. 8 is the opposite of the tool shown in fig. 6; we call him Mouchette. It is used to make, in one go, a torus, a sausage or a rod. There are many species: some of a portion of a large or small circle, and others more or less wide although with different curvatures. To obtain one, it will be enough for an amateur to ask for a No. 6 fly, forming part of a circle of such a number of lines in diameter, and of so many lines in width.

Fig. 9 is. a tool intended to make in relief oe that that fig. 7 made hollow. Nothing is as convenient as removing a strip, a heel or other moulding, with a regular belt, in one go and in an instant; oe which we only obtain with great attention and patience, with a face chisel, or with the sides of a barley grain: still we often see on the work the ribs, coming from of each stroke of the chisel, which we do not turn with enough regularity, and which must be erased, little by little, by multiplying the tool amps which always mark.

Fig. 10 represents a kind of convenient tool in an infinite number of circumstances. It cuts on each side and at the end. It is very difficult to sharpen, particularly on the grinding wheel, to keep the bevels and edges perfectly straight. Without this attention, it can be of absolutely no use; because, suppose you want to draw up the inside of the lid of a case, if the tool has curvatures along its length, we feel that the groove will take very badly, and that the case will be very poorly closed .

Fig. It is the same very narrow chisel, and where the bevels are taken on the spot, to give more solidity to the Toatil, as we said at the barleycorn, Jig. S. The recess which can be seen in the neighboring part of the handle is used so that it rests more securely on the support, and so that, in delicate operations, it does not wobble in the hand; which can spoil, in an instant, everything we have done up to that point.

Fig. 12 still represents a barley grain, of the greatest finesse, for cutting a very thin piece, without losing material, or when space does not allow one to be used. Another: but it is use all these narrow tools with a lot of ptecïutions; otherwise they could get involved in the work, and spoil in an instant everything that had been finished. He will therefore have a pen carried in his hand to the right and to Ganehe, so that the tool always has a little more path than it needs.

Fig. 13 is a donkey's lip as short as the preceding one; we take care that it goes a little decreasing towards the handle, so that it does not engage in the work, but the force is preserved, in light of what it is on its field, which is very large. This tool is only called Bec d'ane because it is very narrow; because it is nothing other than a chisel with a bevel, which has been made very narrow, to make it suitable for the smallest works.

Fig. 14 represents a carp tongue piercer. We see one of the two bevels which are inclined, approximately parallel to each other: a, is the cutting edge, one is the sharp edge of the bevel, which is supposed to be by lesson, as e is the sharp edge towards b, of the front face of the tool. This drill is very good for hard hou and for ivory. For antlers, we dip it in grease, and for ivory, we wet it from time to time with water.

Fig.15 is what is called Ladle, or bondonniere. Nothing is so convenient for growing a hole; and therefore we have a sufficient assortment to lead the smallest hole to the largest diameter. It is with an instrument of this type, but very large, that the wheelwrights enlarge the holes in the hubs to make them the size of the axle.

Fig. 16 is a lathe drill bit. You need to have a good assortment to drill holes of all sizes. The way of sharpening them is very delicate. If we decide to squint from the outside at the edges of the sides and that of the end, the tool will no longer take, given that these edges are in the circle that the tool presents externally, and that the surfaces that we will have described, by starting the tool externally, will no longer be part of the same circle. It is internally that we must sharpen it, and that is not easy. You must obtain a steel tool, which has the shape of a chisel from below, ending in a semi-circle, with almost no bevel. It must be hardened enough, and it will be used to sharpen the edge from inside the bit. You can also use the angle of an unsharpened chisel, or a small, soft half-round file.

Fig. 1, Pl. 13, represents a drill, made roughly like an English drill bit, and which we call Fox's Tail. We see there a point to direct the center, but, on each face of the flat of the tool, is a groove in the opposite direction to the other. The ends of the tool are also made in opposite bevels, near the tip, in order to cut into the material. The two sides also have two opposite bevels. This tool can pierce ivory and other hard materials very well; but, because of all the bevels that are there, it must be guided with caution, so as not to let it engage in the piece, and above all hold it very firmly because of the great effort it experiences.

Fig. 2 is a tool of almost the same type as the previous one, except that it does not have grooves like it. The usefulness of the English drills sufficiently demonstrates that of this tool, which has two opposite bevels at the end, and whose sides are also in opposite bevels.

Fig. 3 is a side tool, the edge of which is taken on the very width of the tool. The side bevel must be made with the greatest care, and above all very straight. The one at the end must make, with the one on the side, a somewhat acute angle, so that, when we dig a piece, which must be square at the bottom, we can be assured of the sharpness of this angle; but, in this case, it is necessary to move the cutting edge a little aside: otherwise, we would make the bottom of the shape of a very obtuse cone, whereas the art consists of making it very straight, and square with the sides.

Fig. 4 is such a very broad tool. We find all kinds of ugly ones for all the pieces we want to dig. And as nothing sharpens the edge of a tool than scraping. the wood, at Tour en l'air, it is suggested to rough up with a gouge or with side hooks which are used for everything; you need to have some of all widths that cut perfectly, and that you keep in reserve, to give the final blow to delicate pieces; This is why it is good to have a sufficient quantity.

Fig. 5 still represents a side tool, the part where the bevel makes a small projection on the body of the tool. This species is still very practical. Where is he? the bevel is more or less long, and the tool more or less wide, to only take material of the length desired, whereas with the preceding ones we cannot avoid cutting the material in all directions. its length. With all tools, the end bevel must be slightly inclined compared to the side bevel, as we said above.

The tool shown in fig. 6, is convenient in an infinity of circumstances where one wants to quickly open a hole on the Tour. It has, as we see, a bevel on each side, and one at the end. When the step decreases, you can only start the material with the bevel on the left and on the left side of the part: thus, the bevel on the right may appear useless. Nevertheless, as the tool, by scraping the wood, removes the pores or filaments in the direction in which the piece turns, we can, with this bevel, lightly cut the wood on the opposite side, and remove, by this means, the son that the bevel on the left only raised. It is for the same reason that when polishing with dry horsetail, it is necessary to use it several times in the direction opposite to that in which the piece was turned; because, as in this direction we lift the threads, in the opposite direction we carry them away.

Fig. 7 represents another type of side tool, the end of which, sharp on one side, is rounded on the other, and yet cuts all around. It is infinitely convenient, being able to form, with the angle, a square or a span, and round at the same moment without being obliged to take another tool: it is on the right and on the left.

Fig. 8 represents a tool of great use, when hollowing out a piece circularly, like a beaker to put powder on the paper; and we give this temple as the easiest to understand. You have to have such tools, with different curvatures, to go everywhere the first time. It is with these tools that we dig a vase, a soap box, etc.

Fig. 9 represents a kind of hinge, sideways, to be able to make a groove on the interior side of a part. They come in all widths, and the bent part is of different lengths. We can use such a tool, very narrow and a little long, to detach, from the inside, a circle that we would like to raise in a piece of ivory, without losing much material.

Fig. 10 is a tool similar to the previous one, except that it makes semi-circular grooves instead of making them square.

Fig. 11 (is a barley grain, aside: when we know the properties of the ordinary barley grain, it is easy to appreciate those of the tool we are talking about.

Fig. 12 is a double-edged lever. It would be to dwell too much on this subject to detail the uses to which all these tools are suited: we appreciate their convenience as we work and acquire knowledge in the art of the Tour. We will simply note that the tools, under the numbers 9, 10, 11
and 12, also cut at the end; and that in this way we can move back at will a groove or miter part of the molding which we would need.

The tool, fig. 13, is of great use, when cutting, in the interior of a part, digging a rounded part, and taking the thickness: the clearance that we see there, allows the tool to be inserted without touching the sides.

Fig. 14 is a kind of barleycorn or curved chisel, the end of which thus cuts the rounded part.

Fig. 15 is a very convenient tool for quickly emptying a box of soft wood; but the use of it is very difficult to acquire: it is called Hook. There are all sizes. We have seen workers whose usual occupation is to make powder bales out of walnut, soap boxes out of alder, or boxes for wetting tobacco out of acacia, digging these boxes with such tools, with such great ease. and such promptness that the shavings, which were jumping all over the workshop, seemed like so many snowflakes obscuring the air. A boot, 6 inches in internal diameter, over the same height, was dug and finished internally in less than 7 to 8 minutes: placing the lid on it, finishing everything externally, was the work of less than a quarter of a minute. 'butter; and we will feel that these workers must acquire great practice, since such a bundle did not cost more than 12 to 15 sols. Charmed by the expedition that this tool provides, we wanted to try to use it; and we are forced to admit that we could not come to any good. Only experience can serve as a teacher. And if any of our readers undertakes to make such boxes, we advise him not to be put off by unsuccessful attempts. It is good to warn that, as the resistance that this tool opposes is great, it is more appropriate to use it only on a Tour carried out with a wheel.

The tool shown in fig. 16 is intended to provide clearance inside a room, for some molding. It makes a grain of barley at the end, and cuts at its end. But, by means of the fact that it is bent to the square, we can make a right angle sharp where we would not have the convenience of carrying another tool.

Fig. 17 is a hook at the end of which is a speck to make a stick in the interior of a hollowed-out room. The decision to reserve a lot of width for these tools serves to give them stability on the support.

Fig. 18 is a circular hook, which, cutting, both in its rounded part and in its hollow part, can form a concave part and an eonvex part, and if necessary clear a molding, or detach a part which would be too much.

Fig. 1, Pl. 14, represents a much longer hook than those we have seen so far. There are several types: some are square, others round, and others are made of barley grain. They can be put on the grindstone, at the light you need.

Fig. 2 is a hook of great length to reach from afar in the parts we want £cmu11w. There are an infinity of others that need and genius carry out every day, and that Mr. Hamelin-Bergeron will take care of passing on as quickly as possible to people who ask for them.

Fig. 3 is a tool suitable for making, with a single “oop, kill you kind of little baluster; we limited ourselves to this pitiful point, to show the reader the ease that we find in making these pieces with a tool which makes them all equally and cheerful. To obtain them, it will be enough to send a profile or a blade of sheet metal or copper, cut, as the amateur sees fit. We can be assured of the liveliness of the edge, the precision in the execution of the proportions, and above all the temper of all these tools.

Fig. 4 is a tool which still executes, with a single stroke, the profile that carpenters call Boavtment à baguettele. This profile is very suitable for round or oval frames.

Fig. 5 is a simple movement, “or, to use the architectural term, an inverted heel.

Fig. 6 is a movement with rebate, or square from the front. In addition to the type of profile that this tool creates, the square which forms the recess also makes it possible to bring, in this place, a circle of wood of a different color from that of the frame, which will be glued with care, and which we will then form into a stick, with the tool which we spoke about above, and which we have designated under the name of Mouchatte.

Fig. 7 is a rather bizarre profile, which, placed in the center of the lid of a box, produces a rather pleasant effect, and forms a rosette.

These are the most common tools for turning wood. It would be an abuse of the patience of our readers to give them the form and profiles of all those we carry out daily.

*** SECTION II. Outils pour tourner le Cuivre.

The tool most commonly used for turning copper is the round chisel, fig. 9. It has the same effect on matter as a gouge does on wood; he roughed it up: but he noticed that as this material, especially when it has been thrown into the mold, is very hard and gravelly, this tool, and all those used for copper, do not have a bevel. ; that the angles are straight and in no way inclined to the surface: by means of which, they can be used in all your directions; but that these angles must be very sharp.

Fig. 8 is a similar half-round chisel; and as it does not have a bevel, it can be used on the right and left.

Barleycorn, fig. 10, is absolutely similar to all those we have seen so far, except that it does not have a bevel.

Fig. It is a square chisel which cuts perfectly, although it also has no bevel: it is used to raise a cylindrical surface; but you must be accustomed to presenting it to the work in the proper direction, to prevent it from chattering: if this happens, you must raise your right hand very high, in order to take the material much below the diameter: by thus changing the position of the tool, by tilting it a little, and taking a little material at a time, although pressing on the work, we will be able to annihilate the waves which could have formed from on board.

Fig. 12 is a side tool, which only resembles those we have spoken about in shape, since it has no bevel. All these tools suitable for turning copper have different uglinesses, each in their own kind, for all cases. It will be enough to designate the number of the board and the tool, with the width in lines, taken from the pied-de-Roi, so that we can obtain it.

Fig. 13 is a strong chisel, which is merciful to copper and iron. The way to hold it is pretty much the same as the one and the other matter. With copper, it is enough to present the side, the bevel below, approximately straight in relation to the part being turned, although below the diameter. The angle is very good for forming corners, fillets or other ornaments on a piece of copper; whereas, for the iron, it was necessary for the surface to be inclined to the work, and for the bevel to almost touch the iron which it could cut above its diameter. This figure represents a chisel of the largest size. There are many intermediates between these large ones and the small ones which are used to turn the bow lathe, and which are used by watchmakers. Commonly a chisel is square, and it is the inclination of the bevel which gives it the diamond shape that we see.

There are also chisels which, to present a more elongated point without the bevel being too long, are diamond shaped instead of square. There are flats, which we call Echoppes, of all shapes, and which are very useful for turning.

*** SECTION III. Outils pour le Fer.

The tools used to turn iron are hooks which are presented to the material, the handle raised and resting on the support, on which small teeth, or notches, fix them so that they cannot move back. . Their bevels, which are below, must be almost parallel to the circumference, and above the diameter.

The first, fig. 15, is round: it roughens your piece like the gouge roughs out bots: the second, fig. 14. is square, to plan the part which must be erected; finally, the barley grain, fig. 16, used as a cleaver to form angles; but it & u t present the tool almost parallel to the place you want to start.

We have already told you: as these tools dull very quickly, you must have a lot of them, and of all widths, if you want to avoid returning to the grindstone every moment. They have been represented here from the side; in order to better feel their shape and the teeth or notches which secure them to the support; their shape, therefore, is represented in section near each of them.

*** SECTION IV. Affutage des Outils, et Ustensils propres à cet usage.

Nothing is as difficult as sharpening a chisel, a plane iron and the like, whether they have two blades or only one. They must first be sharpened on the grindstone, fig. 53, Pl.9, and this operation requires some attention. You must first obtain a good grindstone; The best are those whose grain is soft, even, and shiny and fine. A skillful worker must turn the millstone with great regularity. If the effort we make to put it in motion and keep it moving causes some slightly marked movements of the body, after a short time it is no longer round, and from then on it is almost impossible to sharpen your tool well. Also we commonly judge the quality of a worker by the way in which his tools are sharpened, and by the roundness of his grindstone. It is necessary, as soon as we notice that it stops turning round, to round it with a piece of sheet metal which we present there almost parallel to the axis, resting it on a fixed point, until until it acquired its roundness. We will then also support the tool, presenting it at an angle, so that it does not chatter, and in this position it will cover the entire circular surface of the wheel, so that the wheel turns from left to right; that is to say, as soon as the rotating surface comes on the tool, it goes to the back of the cdut which sharpens. Above all, we must have great attention to making each bevel well plane, and that it presents a very straight line. And, as we must often look at how the bevel is formed, we must also hold our hand at the same elevation: otherwise, we would have as many planes inclined to each other as we would have made repeats; in the same way if while sharpening, the hand which holds the tool varied in position because of the movement of the body, the bevel, instead of being flat, would present a curved surface: which would be a great defect. The bevel must still be taken long, like 6 to 9 lines; if the chisel is a little thick, this operation is quite long, because of the material that must be used; but also The tool cuts much better and much cleaner.

What we have just said about lathe chisels must be understood to apply to all types of chisels, jack irons, planes and other carpentry tools whose bevel must be perfectly flat. If you do not have a grindstone, and you are reduced to sharpening on flat sandstone, you would have to pay the greatest attention to it, and use alone can lead to perfection. It is rare that a person can habituately cut with the bevel, on a sandstone, a line parallel to this sandstone. If we alternately raise and lower the hand, as almost always happens, we feel that the two bevels make two curved lines which intersect at the apex of the angle which is the cutting edge: We must therefore correct this natural error in the movement of the hand. arm. By removing the tool from oneself, one raises one's hand without realizing it, and by pushing it, one lowers it; from which a circular movement arises at the part which rubs, and consequently a curved line.

Bad workers sharpen very quickly, and as they spend very little time on it, they think they are saving in that regard: this is a big mistake; because a short bevel cuts much less well, as we can judge by comparing a razor to the best knife: and moreover, when in order to dull the bevel, it is finally necessary to remove it entirely, losing some . on the grindstone for as long as we thought we would spare each time. Of all the people who calculate the use of workers' time, entrepreneurs have the most exact notions on this subject, and an educated master never reproaches his campagnon for going too often to the grindstone, or to the sandstone, provided let it not be an opportunity or an excuse to waste time.

When sharpening a chisel, fig. 42, Pl. 9, it is necessary to look from time to time at how the bevel is formed, and to mark by the lines of the wheel, the places where it is appropriate to press. Cte holds the tool in his right hand, with his thumb and first two fingers in his left hand; we press on one or the other side, depending on whether we consider it necessary: ​​if the edge becomes hollow or rounded, we press on the corners or on the middle, until it reaches the line RIGHT. When a bevel is finished, turn the tool over, and do the same on the other side. Alots, it is quite ordinary, if one has used a lot to carry away some breaches, to see at the edge a stupid thing, which one. called morfil, which tips over at will from one side to the other, and which must be removed. This operation is infinitely meticulous and difficult. People who are not in the know, and there are many of them, have never known how to give tools the sharp edge that is so necessary: ​​here is how we should go about it.

Place the edge of the instrument perpendicularly, on the corner of a piece of hard wood and wire; we press with a little force, sliding the bevel as if we wanted to cut the wood. The bite disappears instantly; all that remains is to soften the edge.

To do this, we pour a few drops of excellent oil onto the oil stone lying flat on the workbench: we run the chisel over it, describing circles of greater or lesser size, and all eccentric, one in relation to the other, over the entire surface of the stone, so as not to wear it out in one place; but he had to raise his right hand a little, so that the new bevel was imperceptibly more obtuse than the one he had made on the grindstone. The same is done on the other side, always pressing with the index and middle fingers of the bent hand; we soon see a new bit come off, and remain on the stone in one or more pieces. Carefully remove with fingers or
a small rag, this burr; if we neglected to remove it, the tool, passing over it, would chip quite noticeably. We constantly turn the tool on both sides, finally moving it in very small circles, and taking care every time we change sides, to push the tool forward, instead of withdrawing it from us. We feel that, by this means, the stone, wearing away the steel, brings it upon itself; and thus, the morfil is destroyed without any remaining.

As long as the bit is a little strong, the eye is unable to notice it; but at the end, there is only the squint which makes it sensitive: it is with the tips of the fingers lightly pressed and dragging a little, that we can judge the fineness of the edge. We can still, taking the two bevels between the thumb and the index finger, and removing the tool from yourself, judge if a remnant of bit, lying on one side or the other, is not still catching the fingers, and if you still have any felt, he &ut, with great patience, put the tool back on the stone until it cuts perfectly

We must have a good oil stone in a laboratory; the best are those called Fi«rr««f/uZ>eca7if- They come from Turkey, around Constantinople. We will soon teach how to choose them.

There is another type of sharpening stone called Pierre de Lorraine, which is used with oil or water: they are much cheaper than the others, but also much inferior in quality.

A good stone from the Levant must be of a color tending to blond, neither too hard nor too soft, equal in density, having neither nails (these are black or brown dots), nor dragons (kind of veins which marble the stone in brown or dark gray). As these nails and these veins are very hard, the tool, when passing over them, jumps and does not bite, and contracts large breaches; it is necessary to reject them, unless these defects


are not located in a corner, and that the stone is not large enough to be able to do without this place. When you buy a stone, you must coat it with good oil, and pass a well-tempered chisel over it: you will easily judge its nature and its goodness.

By dint of working a stone with oil, and especially by sharpening chisels, or other sharp tools, there are furrows which, by spoiling its surface, prevent it from being scratched. * sharpens scissors and other flat and straight pieces: it must be trained on an ordinary hard stone with a little fine sandstone, and dry

There are many people who, instead of oil stone, the good ones of which are quite expensive, use oils of different kinds and different grains: some wet, others dry. In a case of necessity, those with water, provided that they have a very fine grain, can suffice; dry ones are only suitable for a few crude tools, such as axes, pruning hooks and others: but as steel which wears out, imprints itself on the sharpener after a few moments, it becomes a blackish gray, and no longer wears at all But/rieiït neËiit an edge as fine as a good oil stone. We sometimes see carpenters who, not having the means to obtain them, and. convinced of the necessity of making the edge thinner than it is by taking out the sandstone which they use, have a piece of fine slate without nails, on which, with a little water, they pass their tools as one fiiits on a stone with oil. This method, which is insufficient in itself, at least proves what we have said.

A tool sharpened in this way is precious and requires the greatest care: so when placing it on the workbench where many others are often gathered, be careful that the edge does not hit any of them. The finer and sharper the cutting edge, the more easily it is damaged by the slightest contact; and we soon realize, while turning, if this accident has happened, sending on the work, which moreover becomes very smooth, as many lines as there are breaches in the tool.

As in turning, it is necessary to carry out different preparatory operations which do not require a great finish, and that in these operations the chisel necessarily loses the liveliness of the edge which had been given to it, and that finally when it comes to finish the work, the water no longer has the vivacity so necessary to cut the molds perfectly clean; It is good to have near you a certain quantity of scissors of all widths, and even similar ones to cut through those that cost a little less, and finish with the last sharp ones. So, assuming that we want to turna baluster or a handle very decorated with moldings, as a cylinder must first be turned, it is appropriate that this cylinder be turned quite sharply; but as this sharpness is not of the greatest importance, since we will again use the gouge and other tools to prepare each member of the molding, if we use to make this cylinder the only one If you have a good chisel, it will no longer cut the moldings cleanly enough: you must therefore have several.

A man, busy with what he is milking, places each of the tools that he leaves rather carelessly on the workbench, and pushes them all at once, if he needs to move his dolls aside, to place them near him different compasses, a square, a ruler or other tool: the bevels, meeting although slightly, chip without him noticing it; and when he goes to take a chisel on which he relies, he is completely surprised to see on the work the lines which these gaps cause. We have successfully proven that the best way to prevent these accidents is to have near you, and even at the crossroads, a small rack, which can hold five or six chisels which are put back in their place each time we used it.
 
You can also, if the location does not include the rack we have just spoken about, place the scissors, with their bevels in the air, on the edge of the workbench which is opposite the Turner.

The manner of sharpening gouges., Pl. 12, fig. 1, is quite different and does not involve as many difficulties; to a turner's chisel, to a carpenter's clasp, the steel is in the middle of the thickness, the two surfaces are of well wrought and well welded iron, instead of a gouge, the steel is on the surface interior: the surplus is iron.

You must have a certain number of gouges of different sizes, some for roughing up wood, others for digging grooves and clearings, and all must not be sharpened in the same way: turners in common works have them. very large ones which they sharpen very bluntly, that is to say, their bevel forms part of a very large circle, and they are sharpened very short. This compacting method is good for soft woods, because it offers little resistance, removes larger chips, and consequently the piece is roughed up sooner. It is therefore appropriate to have some of this same type for cases which require them. Commonly, the bevel of a gouge should be neither too long nor too short. The chair turners, and other strong works, have very large and very long ones, pierced by their support cannot get close enough to the recessed parts, and that consequently the

arm of the lever that the gouge makes from the point of support which is the support, up to the resistance which is the work, is too long, in relation to the lever, from, this same point of support, up to the hand; and that it would therefore be necessary to make a considerable effort and to tire a lot, to overcome the resistance of the material and to cut the wood: they are accustomed to having very long gouges and chisels, sometimes even fitted with handles that are still very -long that they grasp between the arm and the rib to have more strength.

This method is worthless for delicate works, which must have a certain finish; moreover, as long as you get used to it, you can more easily control and attach an average tool to contours decorated with moldings than if it were much larger. These tools should be approximately 10 to 12 inches fully fitted.

We sharpen a gouge underneath, that is to say, by the round part, by rotating it between the fingers of the left hand which supports the wheel, and holding it firmly with the right hand by the handle. As the steel is found in the groove, it is necessary that the bevel is also rounded, and that the bit also extends into this groove; but the way of sharpening is not the same as with the chisel, since the groove must be perfectly straight and in no way beveled. You can find ready-made sharpeners at the Publisher; these are bluish gray ufl stones whose grain is very fine: we must have them of all thicknesses, for the different kinds of gouges: but if we want to prepare them or straighten them when they are dug in the middle, we round off the fields on a very straight and well-fired tile. We hold the sharpener between the thumb and the first two fingers, and we run it along the length of the tile, which, being very hard and full of roughness, wears the stone very quickly; We can even, if the tile loses its grain, spread a little powdered sandstone on it.

When the rack is thus rounded, we first take a flat and well-dressed one; we immerse it in water, and we pass it on the bevel, tilting it a little towards the edge. For this operation and for the next, we hold the gouge towards its end between the thumb and index finger of the left hand, and holding the sharpener with the right, we pass it several times over the bevel going down towards the handle : in this way, the bit is soon reversed towards the inside of the gouge; pnis, with a round sharpener that we wet abundantly, we force the bit to detach itself from the gouge, by only lowering the sharpener into the gouge, and applying it exactly to the entire groove: by this means, we are assured that the groove remains straight, and that there is only a bevel on the outside.

This operation is sufficient for the gouges to be roughed; but when they must be used to make very narrow grooves where the narrowest chisel can only be used by a very skillful hand, as in the groove of a very thin pulley which must be very smooth, then it is necessary that the gouge cuts much finer than the others.

We still find sharpeners of the same nature as oil or Levant stones, of all sizes, for all tools and all cases. It is with such sharpeners that we finish the edge of the edges that we want to cut very finely.

We are now going to talk about a tool which is only good for wood and very hard materials (such as boxwood, wood, etc.), but which beginners make frequent use of, because it - favors their negligence in training their hand with the chisel which must almost always take its place; it is the barley grain, figs. 4 and 5, Pl. 12.

This tool is sharpened so that its top presents a more or less acute angle, depending on the need. The two sides or bevels of this angle are not at right angles to the top of the tool, but they make a more or less acute angle with it, depending on the materials for which it is intended. Also, for hard woods, these angles must be quite sharp, and, for copper, they must be straight. This tool is very difficult to sharpen well on the grindstone, because of the difficulty of holding it between the fingers when used. the left bevel; moreover, each of these bevels must be very straight, and the apex of the angle they form must be exactly in the middle of the width of the tool; finally, that the bevels are also inclined. We pass the tool over the stone and the oil, placing each of the faces absolutely flat, until they are very sharp and very sharp.

The scissors used to cut soft wood and crooked wood on the lathe are sharpened differently. After having cut the sharpener, as in the previous one, we return the sharpener, passing a burnisher inclined at approximately 45 degrees, on the top of the cutting edge, pressing a little hard and evenly. This makes the cutting edge perpendicular to the flat of the tool.

Cabinetmaker's scrapers are sharpened according to this principle; but, as they do not have a bevel, we turn the thread over the two angles.

Hooks, for turning iron, Pl. 14, fig. 14, 15 and 16, are sharpened on the grindstone, but in another way. Whereas in all the sharpenings of which we have spoken, the wheel turns opposite to the one who sharpens; in this one, on the contrary, it returns to him, or rather to the tool. Several workers place the tool on a support placed very close to the stone, and they move the round tool, fig. 15, to give it its semi-circular shape. This way is the most used; it is vicious, because in three or four strokes of the pedal the wheel is started, and grooves are formed there; moreover the cutting edge produced by this sharpening is always furrowed.

The best way is to place the back of the tool on the index finger of the left hand, and to bring the grindstone to you in the same way. With the right hand which holds the maucbe, we direct the tool, and we turn it in all the directions that its shape requires.

We will not dwell further on the sharpening of tools, and we will content ourselves with the general principles explained above; We reserve the right, by indicating the use of each tool, to explain the particular way of sharpening it when necessary.

* PART II. DU TOUR A POINTES.
** CHAPTER I. Préparation des Bois pour Tourner.

Before putting a piece of wood on the lathe, you must, depending on what you want to do with it, take the necessary measures so that, being turned, it can fulfill the purpose you are proposing. Beginners are wrong often on this point: they judge that a particular piece will be big enough; and, being rounded, it is too small: fear then causes us to fall into an opposite excess; and if we turn precious wood, we lose in chips, wood which, if handled better, could have been used for something else or be better used.

It is therefore necessary, to ensure whether the piece that we intend to turn will be able to fulfill the object we propose, take a point on each of its ends, and check whether from this point, known center, we can describe a circle with a diameter equal to that of the cylinder you want to obtain. This means will suffice when the piece is straight, or has been previously dressed with an ax or jack; but if the piece was not perfectly straight, we feel that, pns.entw ks.dftWE; points, the part which makes the belly will fall into chips, and we will only reach the hollow part by greatly reducing the Tenfied part. In this case, we will center the part where we need the entire diameter, off-centering that of the ends, which must be smaller.

To roughen a piece of wood with the tarpaulin, we cannot avoid resting it on a standing log, fig. 54, Pl. 9, more or less high, depending on whether you want to work sitting or standing; We usually take for this use a piece of twisted elm, and rarely wire: the ax, falling on a block of this type, is not subject to chipping; and even its cutting edge is infinitely more gentle than if it were a piece of crooked wood: this block must be as heavy and of as large a diameter as possible, without harming the floor by its gravity. who wears it; the heavier it is, the less the blows will be heard from the neighboring rooms of the laboratory, and the physical reason for this fact is easy to feel: it is the same for all your utensils intended to receive strong and multiplied blows, such as anvil block, and vices for forging or planing, carpentry workbenches, lathe workbenches, which, as we will see later, must have a certain thickness: here is this reason.

A blow, struck on any body, tends to move it. It is for this reason that a nail enters without a hammer blow: but if we want to drive this nail in with a hammer that is too weak, it will not enter; and its resistance being greater than the power, the blow will be heard, in the distance: but if the hammer is much stronger, the nail will enter, and the noise will be less great, given that part of the mass, at approximately equal to the force of the blow, being displaced, a large part of this mass loses almost all its reaction. If therefore the block is weak, almost all of its mass being loosened, it will communicate its impulse to the floor, and the noise of each blow will be perceptible in the neighboring rooms: if on the contrary the block is very heavy, as a great effort is required to move it, a blow, however violent it may be, will be absorbed in the mass, and the noise will be almost zero for the neighbors.

It is by a continuation of this principle that when a nail is driven into a wooden partition, someone is placed behind it to counter-hold; otherwise, the partition being forced by the blow to retract, the effort of the hammer on the nail is partly lost. It is by the same principle that a shot fired from a bullet perpendicular to the most mobile weathervane pierces it without it having time to be moved, because the movement is very accelerated, and the air counterholds it. , the hole is made sooner than it is moved. There is yet another rather ingenious way to prevent the noise of an anvil or a pile on which one is forging from being heard in neighboring rooms: it is to force the block into a barrel large enough to accommodate it. contain it very far out: we fill with earth, or better still fine sand, all the void left by the block, and we take care that there is at least 3 to 4 inches underneath. It is clear from what we have just said that the blows are thus cushioned, and that the soft body, interposed, is not suitable for transmitting the movement, and consequently the sound.

When to turn a piece of wood, you want to take it from a log or any other piece of wood, you must first carefully examine which way it is best to take it, to avoid a knot, a split , sapwood or other defect. When we have decided, we will cut the piece along its length; then, examining if it is made of thread, if some knot does not disturb this thread, we will try to split it with a coulter or wedges: but we. can never take enough care to split a piece of wood: unless it has been used for a long time, it is rare that a beginner does not reduce a piece that was much too large to being too small; at the moment you least expect it, the grain gets disturbed and the split goes all wrong: besides, there is very little wood that you have to risk splitting. The safest way is to cut them with a saw. It is used in this way for all the woods of the islands which we have spoken about elsewhere.

Of all woods, ash is the one that splits the most, straight, because its annual layers being very marked and of a density much greater than that of the medullary substance, the split cannot pass from one layer to the other. And, without naming here all the other species of wood, it is enough, to judge their readiness to be split, to know their texture, the way in which they manage themselves on their feet, and the accidents which can occur to them. Thus the twisting elm can never be split, because, bristling in its length, with an infinity of branches which are cut to size, and which form as many excrescences or burls, by the extravasation of nourishing juices , its texture is interrupted by an infinity of knots which twist the fibers, and make of them only a mass of filaments intertwined with each other. This is why it is very good for making large car hubs, and why it receives and retains the strongest and most solid locking.

The wild apple tree cannot split for any other reason. Anyone who has seen roads lined with apple trees in Normandy must have noticed that their position and location must arrange their filaments in such a way as to never be straight. These fibers, if you pay attention, are usually arranged in the shape of a torso: also, if you persist in splitting a piece of wildling, it is not uncommon for the split to turn on itself, and arrives at the other end, square to the line from which we started. Workers call the wood of this species Rolled Wood. We can clearly see that the precautions that we have just indicated for the sale of timber specific to the Tour must be applied to their roughing with the tarpaulin; that it is not enough to have split a piece if, in wanting to rough it, we take too much wood against the grain.

Suppose we want to turn a cylinder one inch in diameter, and we have to take it from a log or a board; in either case, here is how we should go about it. We must first examine whether one of the ends can be used, given that, in logs, the end is always split into an infinity of rays, which increase when the work is finished: and even when we do not You don't see these cracks, they don't exist at all, and when the work is finished, the moldings fall off by themselves. Nothing can make this assertion as sensitive as the case where we turn the legs of garden boxes: if the apple which is at each leg is caught in split wood, we see after a while a part of the sphere detaches, and it ceases to be what it was

It is therefore necessary to remove, with a saw, the end of any piece of wood caught in a log or other piece of wood which has been exposed to the air for a long time. You must then take more length than you need, if you find that the holes in the points do not appear. Finally, as it is rare for wood to be sawed perfectly straight, it is necessary, in all cases, to take more wood than the length of the piece requires.

If one fears spoiling a precious piece, or that lack of use does not make one sufficiently master of the ax, one should take with a compass with good steel points and strong enough not to be flexible, approximately two lines longer than half the diameter of the measurement you want to follow requires it. This opening will give the radius of the circle to trace. We will place the point on one of the ends of the piece that we want to turn, and turning the compass, we. will see if the circle is inscribed in the surface of the wood. If there is a void on one or other side, we would move the point back in the opposite direction, until the point describes a circle on the end of the part, and or trace it in a fairly sensitive. We will repeat this operation at the other end: then, placing the piece of wood on the carpentry bench, we will remove, with the half-varlope or riffiard, all the angles, approaching the circle at each end, and without taking on the compass line: we will do the same at all the angles which exceed the circle, and the piece will be ready to be turned.

If you don't have a carpentry workbench, you will have to use an axe. But as we assume that we do not yet have the use of it, and that if we want to go hard, we risk injuring ourselves, here are the main precautions to prevent the danger. We will place the piece on the block, holding it by the other end; We will chop lightly and with small strokes as if we wanted to make the piece a little conical from the bottom. By this means, we will be sure to remove only enough wood to reach the circle. We will turn the piece end for end, and we will do the same: after which, we will be able to judge by eye, by chopping from one circle to another, if the line is straight, and there is wood to remove. We will repeat here, in favor of the aHumanças, that he does not strike with the ax on very inclined wood, for fear of taking too much wood, of creating too profenid hatchings, which cannot be erased on the Turn; and what is more important, lest the blow, struck a little hard, cause the piece to fall from the hand holding it, and the ax then slipping to injure them, especially when the attention is mainly directed on the piece, and that the desire to sketch quickly, and to take away large chips, still distracts her. This is not as useless as one might think; we have seen it happen several times: unless you are perfectly in milk, it is better, at the risk of taking longer, to strike with the ax almost parallel to the bone; we will take little material; the ax will often fall on the block, but we run no risk, and we do not tilt the piece.

When the wood is thus prepared as round as possible, it can be held in a strong wooden or iron vice, then with a flat rasp, remove the angles that the ax has necessarily left; but, as long as one has already handled the gouge, this is absolutely useless.

** CHAPTER II Manière de Tourner.

*** SECTION I. Tourner un Cylindre.

A well-turned cylinder is the simplest and at the same time the most difficult of all the parts that we make on the Tour: it is the principle of everything that can be done there, because it is the only part where one is obliged to direct the chisel perfectly; to maintain the given size and to judge the roughness sufficiently well, to achieve it perfectly with the gouge, so that all that remains is to level with the chisel. So this is where we had to start: this is what we will never stop proposing to beginners.

A wealthy man buys a complete tour, the oval, the eccentric is included; sometimes also a guilloche turn: he thinks he can make a snuffbox, guilloche it, etc., because he has seen you do it. To reduce him to rotating a simple cylinder between two points, to repeat this operation several times, is undoubtedly to condemn him to the greatest boredom; but art is not bought, it is acquired; and we do not fear to assure that those of our readers who want to devour this bore and who will only move on to other works after having succeeded in this first, will have the satisfaction of succeeding in everything they undertake through your following.

To put the rough piece on the lathe, we will first fix the headstock on the left, very solidly, by passing through the eye of the Roman screw, the shank of a key which we must always have close to. itself, and which is used to advance and retreat the screw point that we are going to talk about. (We know that all screws are tightened by turning from left to right, and loosened in the opposite direction.) We will say nothing here about the metal that used to be used to fix the dolls on the workbench, by means of wooden keys which enter into a mortise made at the tail of the dolls, and which the Turners in common works have retained the use of. This method causes considerable noise, and a shock which is communicated throughout an entire house. Furthermore, when the workbench is very wide, it is very difficult to loosen the corner, since you have to bend down and, with a mallet or an iron mass, strike on its small end, which is towards the part rear of the workbench; whereas ordinary turners, having only simple twins for workbenches, made up of two frames, mounted on a crow's foot foot, which gives hardly more than 100 inches in width, can easily drive out the corners, both by in front' than from behind without bending down, making them overflow from one side to the other.

So when the headstock on the left is thus firmly fixed, we approach the headstock on the right, approximately at the distance given by the length of the cylinder that we want to turn, and we fix it in this place as solidly as the other : then, passing the tip of the key through one of the eyes a, fig. 1, Pl. 15, which are on the head of the screw point b of the headstock on the right, we put the piece of wood on the Lathe, making the points enter the hole left by the compass, when we traced the circle at each end; and we advance the pointed screw, so that both enter into the wood about two lines each: we then make the rope, on the cylinder, make two turns from left to right, so that the ascending and descending rope facing the worker: through this hub, when you put your foot on the step or pedal, the wood turns and comes to find the tool. We put a drop of oil on each tip to make the friction more gentle.

You must always have an oil can near you when turning, fig. 11, Pl. 15, to be able to put a drop of oil on each tip. This cruet must be conical in shape with a very large base lest it tip over. It must have a hinged lid, so that the shavings that the gouge jumps on all sides do not enter the oil.

It is necessary not only for the Tour, but also for all kinds of operations and tools that require it, to use the best olive oil; everything else thickens in the cruet, at the collars of the shaft, at the axles of the wheels, and especially dries on the oil stone, and prevents scissors and other tools from being sharpened very sharply.

It is rare that the rope is of a suitable length for your piece to make enough revolutions, from the elevation to which the step is carried by the spring of the pole, until it touches the ground. A little use will soon teach you how tightly it needs to be fixed.

The pole can be replaced by a nn^ arc j^ace in the above manner. At both ends of the workbench stand two columns or two pilasters which can be fluted for greater convenience.

Two gallows placed at the top of each of these columns carry a crosspiece through which passes a wooden or copper box which accommodates the middle of the arch.

These bows are done in several ways; some are made of steel and only one. piece, the two ends of which are joined by four ropes which pass through a wooden barrel. These have the disadvantage of being too soft when at rest, and too hard when tense; also the use of it is almost abandoned today, and it is replaced by an arch made up of three or four strips of fir placed on the flat, below which are small rollers of leather so that the movement is
more uniform and softer, and at the end of which a stretched rope is fixed to form a spring equivalent to that of the pole. On this rope is a small wooden pulley with a hook on the bus into which the loop of the rope of the Tour enters. When, by lowering the step, the rope drops, your ponlie necessarily goes to the lowest point, and is always perpendicular to the tree of the Tour and to the step, whether we turn at the Tour in the air , or at the Tour k points: and, oomrae it is often necessary to carry the rope to the right or to the left, which is done by pushing the pole on the bar, we obtain the same effect by leading the box to the right or to the left; by this means the rope is always perpendicular to the workbench.

We still make these blades in very soft and very thin tempered steel, similar to those of which car springs are made, and whose elasticity is known; but bows made of fir blades are preferable, their spring is as soft as that of the pole, and yet quite firm.

Finally, we can also use a pole also made up of several very thin fir strips, increasing in length, the shortest below.

If we use a steel bow with a barrel, the first turn of the barrel is too gentle: it is therefore necessary that the step, at its highest degree of elevation, experiences a little resistance from there from the fessort; and to increase it, we will keep the rope short enough so that the step is called a little higher when it is left to itself, and for this the barrel must make approximately one revolution when the sleeve is raised. By this means, when turning, one will feel an equal resistance throughout the lowering of the step. But, if we made the beginning of the development of the barrel a little too rough, it would be infinitely too much when the march came close to the ground, and in addition to the fatigue that the turner would experience, the work would also suffer. The movement must be gentle without being either weak or strong.

Ordinarily the step forms a kind of Greek λ or ι, ending in a bar: all assembled solidly with mortises and tenons. It is fixed to the legs of the workbench, using hinges. We wrap part of the bar, which moves parallel to the groove of the Tower, with a large quantity of rope which we are going to talk about, so as not to be obliged to renew it often: and to lengthen or shorten the rope as appropriate, just do one more or less turn.

Sometimes also, and this method is more ingenious and more convenient, the bar carries in part of its length a groove c, 6 to 8 lines wide. We pass a square bolt into this groove which fills it approximately, and whose slightly wide head is on the underside. The excess of the bolt is tapped, and a piece of some firm wood, such as walnut, birch, beech or other, is inserted into this part, 4 to 6 inches long, the width of the step, and 9 10 lines thick, which is held there by a wing nut, which is tightened and tightened as desired. The other end of this piece is split along its length of approximately 2 inches, to receive the rope, which by this means cannot escape or change from the place where we want it to be: and, if we are obliged to carry the rope on a part more to the right of the part that is being turned, we loosen the nut e, and we make the moving part flow onto the step, so that the rope is plumb from the place where we want it to be on the work: without this, we feel that this rope, always brought by the end of the step towards the left, would not remain on the part further to the right of the work where we would need it she was.

We. seen in fig. 1, that the step or pedal is not a straight line, but that it is a little bent towards its end where the groove is. We use it in this way, so that the rope passes into the groove when coming out from above the piece that is being turned without it rubbing against the binoculars, since this part c responds peipendicularly to the groove.

This method is still useful, when, without removing the Tour en l'air which is there from the workbench, you want to turn between two points, which forces you to place the dolls towards the right: but then it is good that the The arch can flow from right to left, on a bar carried by two consoles of wood or iron, such as we have just described above.

Some people, instead of a pedal fixed to the workbench, the determined length of which cannot be very large, use a pine bar of good wire, and 5 feet long or approximately, 4 inches wide , and thick with lines, which we place at will, and which we pass from the right foot to the left foot, according to need. By this means, you can turn in all parts of the length of the Tour, without needing to change your rope except on the work. This bar is split at one end to allow the rope to pass through, and even this use is very convenient to lengthen or shorten it as needed, by turning the bar to one side or the other.

To reduce the noise that this step communicates in the lower room, we cut the other end into two rounded bevels, and we attach a double strip of felt to it with pinnails.

Common work turners have an A-shaped pedal, fig. 2, Pl. 15, one of the legs of which is extended from above, and at the end of which they wrap the rope; but as this A is hardly more than 18 inches to 2 feet long, it is the radius of too small a circle, and is not very convenient for the piece being turned to be able to make several
revolutions.

Nothing is as simple as the construction of this A: each of the three bars that compose it is assembled to the others halfway through the wood, and fixed with nails riveted from below.
